### [Learning from the success of the Swachh Bharat Mission](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/learning-from-the-success-of-the-swachh-bharat-mission-9557184/)

A study published in Nature found that the construction of over 11 crore household latrines under the Swachh Bharat Mission (SBM) has saved an estimated 60,000-70,000 infant lives annually. The decline in open defecation, facilitated by the subsidized provision of toilets, has significantly reduced the incidence of water and food contamination, leading to lower rates of infant and child mortality. 

The study highlights the crucial role of sanitation in improving child health outcomes, alongside efforts to ensure universal access to safe drinking water.  Sustained national sanitation programs, like SBM, coupled with initiatives like the Jal Jeevan Mission, have the potential to further reduce stunting and wasting in children by addressing the root causes of malnutrition.

### [Vandita Mishra writes: In the Modi government’s third term so far, signs of politics opening up, and remaining frozen](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/modi-government-third-term-politics-9557090/)

The 2024 election results have led to a more balanced political landscape, pushing the ruling government to adopt a less authoritarian approach.  The Supreme Court has shown signs of institutional pushback, affirming individual rights and condemning practices like "bulldozer justice."  

Within the BJP, there are visible cracks with the RSS chief seemingly challenging PM Modi's stance.  Additionally, the party is facing internal struggles due to ticket distribution complexities in the upcoming Haryana elections. However, concerns remain as the Court's authority on hate crimes appears weak, exemplified by the recent assault on a Muslim man on a train.  Police inaction and the escalating climate of impunity fueled by vigilantism pose a threat to social harmony. The government's silence on these issues further compounds the concern.

Despite initial clearance by the CBFC with minor modifications, objections from Sikh groups and a PIL seeking a ban have arisen. While the film's quality is not the primary concern, the incident raises questions about the CBFC's role as a tool for political censorship, especially given the government's focus on commemorating the Emergency as a violation of democratic principles.  The incident echoes the banning of "Kissa Kursi Ka", a satirical film about Indira and Sanjay Gandhi, highlighting the danger of silencing dissenting voices through censorship.

The hijacking of Indian Airlines Flight IC 814 in 1999 was a significant blow to India's intelligence and security. While the involvement of Pakistan's ISI and the terrorist group Harkat-ul-Mujahideen (HuM) was evident, Indian intelligence failed to prevent the hijacking due to temporary loss of valuable assets and insufficient anticipation of Pakistan's strategy. The hijacking highlighted vulnerabilities in India's security apparatus and exposed the reality of Pakistan's influence in Afghanistan under the Taliban. 
The Netflix series "IC 814: The Kandahar Hijack" distorts the events by suggesting involvement of Osama bin Laden and Al Qaeda, despite no evidence to support these claims. The series also depicts inaccurate details about the role of R&AW and the presence of specific terrorists among the hijackers.  The incident underscores the need for accurate historical accounts and wider access to information from retired intelligence personnel.

While the BJP has secured a strong majority in the recent election, Prime Minister Modi faces challenges as perceptions surrounding his leadership style shift.  His previous two terms saw an image of absolute power, which, while appreciated by some, also raised concerns about democratic norms.  Recent events, such as backtracking on amendments to the Waqf Board Act and changes in Assam’s legislature rules, have fueled perceptions of weakness and raised concerns among allies. Modi's unwavering stance during the farm protests and Brij Bhushan Singh controversy seems to have backfired electorally.  Moving forward, Modi needs to strike a balance between projecting strength and exhibiting pragmatism, while also addressing concerns over the use of the Enforcement Directorate to target political opponents and fostering greater consultation with allies.

In 1968, India gifted Trinidad and Tobago a Speaker's Chair, symbolizing shared democratic values, six years after the nation gained independence. The chair was delayed due to the intricate craftsmanship involved and the illness of one of the two specialized woodcarvers.  The gift, presented by then-Indian High Commissioner Muni Lal, was acknowledged by the Parliament as a reminder of the unity between the two countries,  especially given the historical contribution of Indian indentured laborers to Trinidad and Tobago's present society. The chair now continues to be used by the country's Speaker, representing a lasting symbol of their connection.

Over the past three Paralympic Games, the number of medals won by Indian women para-athletes has surged from zero to eleven.  This progress is attributed to policy changes, increased societal acceptance, and a shift in the perception of para-sports.  

The Paralympic Committee of India has transitioned from a charitable organization to a professional sporting body, providing athletes with training, support, and funding.

The arrest, which stemmed from allegations of non-compliance with law enforcement requests, has sparked debate about the balance between free speech and content moderation.

### [Ram Madhav writes: How Modi government tackled Maoism in India](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ram-madhav-writes-how-modi-government-tackled-maoism-in-india-9554358/)

The Maoist insurgency in India, a five-decade-long violent movement rooted in Mao Zedong's ideology, is nearing its end.  The movement, which gained prominence in the 1970s and reached its peak in 2010, controlled significant territory and claimed thousands of lives. While earlier governments struggled to contain it, the Modi government's approach, focusing on counter-terrorism, state coordination, and development in affected regions, has significantly weakened the Maoists. Through military operations, infrastructure development, and incentivizing surrenders, the government has reduced Maoist influence and violence drastically.  Disillusionment within Maoist ranks, coupled with global failings of communist ideology, further contributes to their weakening.

India is experiencing rapid economic growth, but this progress comes at a cost to the mental well-being of its youth.  Studies reveal a concerning rise in mental health issues among adolescents, linked to factors such as early smartphone usage, high consumption of ultra-processed foods, sedentary lifestyles, and weakened family relationships.  Alarmingly,  youth from wealthier backgrounds, who consume more processed foods, are less physically active, and experience strained family ties, demonstrate poorer mental health compared to their less affluent peers who engage in healthier habits and maintain strong family connections.  This trend highlights the urgent need for intervention. Policymakers, schools, parents, and the private sector must work together to address this growing mental health crisis before it jeopardizes India's demographic dividend.

### [Sanjay Srivastava writes: Why we must talk about caste](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sanjay-srivastava-writes-why-we-must-talk-about-caste-9554353/)

The article argues that ignoring caste in India doesn't make it disappear; it only reinforces existing inequalities. The author critiques the idea that caste is simply a matter of thought and memory, pointing out that it manifests both formally and informally.

Rahul Gandhi's comment about the lack of representation of lower castes in beauty pageants, though seemingly trivial, highlights the pervasiveness of caste discrimination. The author suggests that to truly understand this issue, we need to analyze not only the visible barriers but also the invisible ones embedded in societal attitudes and cultural capital. 

The author uses examples of conversations about caste in Haryana and academia to illustrate how upper castes often justify their privilege by attributing "merit" and "inclinations" to specific castes, perpetuating a hierarchy that limits opportunities for others.  The article concludes that acknowledging and addressing both formal and informal discrimination is crucial to dismantle the caste system effectively.

Teachers' Day should be a time to reflect on the challenges faced by marginalized academicians, including disabled professors. Disabled professors disrupt ableist assumptions about universities and knowledge production, bringing unique perspectives and experiences. However, they often face systemic barriers like a heavy workload, ableist expectations of "neutral" knowledge, and limited opportunities for agency.  The emphasis on "publish or perish" metrics can be particularly disadvantageous, as these often prioritize knowledge derived from abled experiences.

It is crucial to recognize that disabled professors challenge dominant paradigms and offer a more inclusive approach to knowledge formation.  Their presence enriches the academic environment and contributes to a more equitable and democratic understanding of knowledge.  By challenging ableist structures and celebrating the diverse experiences of disabled professors, we can move towards a truly inclusive and enriching academic community.

This reversal  contravenes existing laws that mandate inclusive healthcare for marginalized groups.  The outdated definitions perpetuate stigma and discrimination, further hindering access to quality healthcare for  LGBTQI+ and disabled individuals.   The NMC must prioritize the dignity and well-being of all citizens by fully integrating inclusive and ethical healthcare practices into medical education.

The Aparajita Woman and Child Bill 2024, passed unanimously by the West Bengal Assembly, proposes stringent punishments for rape, including the death penalty in certain cases. While the bill aims to address the loopholes in existing laws, it raises concerns about its effectiveness in combating a deeply rooted culture of misogyny. Studies show that stricter laws alone do not deter crime, and institutional challenges like a lack of due process and system-wide insensitivity towards survivors persist. The bill also overlooks the need for broader societal change, including challenging patriarchal norms at the grassroots level. True progress requires addressing the systemic factors that contribute to gender-based violence, not just enacting punitive measures.

### [World Bank raises India’s growth forecast: An upward tick](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/world-bank-india-growth-9550786/)

The World Bank has increased its growth prediction for the Indian economy to 7 percent for the current year, citing a rebound in rural incomes due to a good monsoon and increased consumption.  While investment growth is expected to moderate, the Bank remains optimistic about India's medium-term prospects, predicting an average growth rate of 6.7 percent between 2025 and 2027. 

However, the report points out that India has struggled to capitalize on the export opportunities created by China's receding market share in low-skill manufacturing.  This is partly attributed to high tariffs and non-tariff barriers, leading to a decline in both direct and indirect export-related employment.


The Bank recommends reducing tariffs, entering into more free trade agreements, and increasing integration with global value chains to address these challenges.

### [Why India should not have the Right to Disconnect](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/right-to-disconnect-india-9550785/)

India's unique economic context makes a blanket application of the "Right to Disconnect" law potentially harmful.  While advocating for work-life balance is crucial,  the "Right to Disconnect" philosophy, which emphasizes disconnecting from work-related communications outside official hours, might not be suitable for a rapidly developing economy like India's.

The Indian workforce, driven by ambition and a strong work ethic, typically views work as a source of identity and purpose.  Lowering work hours could impede progress and limit India's ability to compete in the global market. 

Instead of solely focusing on disconnecting, a more balanced approach that recognizes the importance of hard work and productivity while ensuring a healthy and motivated workforce is essential for India's continued growth.

### [How agriculture can be an engine for growth](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/agriculture-engine-growth-9549171/)

Indian agriculture needs to transform to be a driver of growth and create desirable jobs. While the sector has seen growth, it faces ecological and technological challenges.  To improve productivity and income, irrigation, particularly rainwater harvesting and micro-irrigation, needs to be expanded. Soil health must be addressed through crop diversity and agro-ecological farming.  

Institutional innovations such as voluntary farmer cooperatives can help overcome the limitations of small farm sizes. These groups can pool resources, invest in technology, and negotiate better market prices. Connecting agriculture with allied sectors like livestock and fisheries, and strengthening linkages with the rural non-farm sector can further boost growth and job creation.

Food plays a vital role in India's culture and economy. Ensuring food safety and security is crucial for the nation's progress.  Food safety incidents can have significant economic and health consequences. To address these challenges, India is investing in food irradiation technology, which extends product shelf life, reduces spoilage, and minimizes food loss.

The upcoming India-Singapore meeting will likely address shared regional concerns like the situation in Myanmar and explore new avenues for cooperation, including potential Chinese investment in India. 


While Singapore's success as a global hub highlights India's potential, it also underscores the need for India to address its own regulatory and structural challenges to fully leverage this partnership.

The Supreme Court has condemned "bulldozer justice," the practice of demolishing properties of crime suspects. The court's intervention, long awaited, recognizes the misuse of power and violation of citizen rights.  While the court proposes guidelines, concerns remain regarding its effectiveness. The court faces skepticism over its ability to enforce its directives considering past instances where its pronouncements against hate speech have been largely ineffective. Greater action from lower courts, law enforcement, and a political climate that discourages hate speech are necessary for tangible change. The court must ensure its actions are timely and meaningful, as reversing the damage caused by bulldozer justice is often impossible.

Manipur continues to experience violence and unrest despite the state government's assurances of peace. The recent attack in Koutruk, involving sophisticated weaponry, has underscored the fragility of the situation. A BJP MLA has called for the withdrawal of central forces and a change in the security force command, attributing the continued violence to their ineffectiveness. 

The ongoing crisis stems from deep-rooted ethnic tensions between the Meiteis and the Kuki-Zos, fueled by economic and political marginalization. 

The demand for ST status for the Meiteis and the subsequent backlash from the Kuki-Zos highlight the state government's failure to address these structural issues. Instead of focusing on dialogue and reconciliation, the government has been quick to frame the crisis as a law-and-order problem, diverting attention from the underlying causes.

Rahul Gandhi's upcoming US visit presents both opportunities and challenges for the Congress Party.

The visit coincides with a larger trend of Indian political parties engaging with the diaspora, a development that has grown in significance alongside India's economic and military rise. This engagement, however, is increasingly scrutinized by host countries and potentially prone to domestic political biases.  

The Congress, in particular, needs to revitalize its foreign affairs department to effectively navigate this shifting global landscape. The article contrasts the Congress's historic engagement with the world with its current limitations, suggesting a renewed commitment to internationalism is crucial.

She praises IndiGo's new feature allowing women to see where other women are seated during web check-in, initially viewing it as a positive step. However, she argues that this move exemplifies "neoliberal feminism," placing the onus of safety on women rather than addressing the root cause of men's entitled behaviour. 

She contends that the feature normalizes male harassment by suggesting women pay for a safer experience. The author concludes that token "feminist" measures are insufficient and true change requires addressing the systemic issues that create hostile public spaces for women.

Bangladesh's history is marked by its struggle for independence from Pakistan in 1971. The newly formed nation grappled with economic challenges, political turmoil, and the interplay between secularism and religious identity. Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, the country's first leader, was assassinated in 1975, ushering in a period of military rule and a shift towards an Islamic national identity.  

Eventually, civilian rule returned, witnessing a pendulum swing between the more secular Awami League and the more Islamic BNP.  In the 21st century, Bangladesh saw remarkable economic progress, surpassing India in per capita income. However, this growth did not quell social and political unrest.  The recent fall of the Sheikh Hasina government highlights the importance of balancing economic development with job creation and respecting dissent.

The ban on sugar mills producing ethanol directly from cane has been lifted, and rice can be procured from government stocks for ethanol production.  With bumper crops expected, the government is considering relaxing the ban on white non-basmati rice exports and removing restrictions on sugar exports. Lifting these curbs is crucial to avoid future supply gluts and ensure farmers receive fair prices.

The Court has also scrutinized stringent penal statutes like the PMLA and NDPS Act, urging them to be interpreted in a way that respects constitutional safeguards and the presumption of innocence.  These judgments stress the paramountcy of the Constitution and the protection of individual liberties against potentially oppressive legal processes.

### [What happens when AI replaces human creativity?](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/what-happens-when-ai-replaces-human-creativity-9546125/)

Richard Linklater's "Boyhood" exemplifies how technology has become a constant in our ever-changing world.  Just as oil shapes our narratives, data and digital technologies are now driving storytelling.  

However, the rise of AI in creative industries raises concerns.  AI models are trained on vast amounts of human-generated data, often without consent or compensation,  potentially leading to the appropriation of cultural heritage. 

This raises questions about the ethics of data use and the need for regulation to protect both creators and consumers.   While AI can offer certain benefits, it’s crucial to ensure it doesn't stifle human creativity, perpetuate biases, or exploit cultural resources for profit.  A balanced approach that prioritizes human values and ethical considerations is essential for the future of storytelling.

Ahead of a world Sikh convention, authorities imposed strict measures in Amritsar, suspending vehicle movement and detaining over 1,250 Akali Dal activists and SGPC members. Despite the restrictions, many leaders managed to enter the Gurudwara Shaheedan, the convention venue. 

In Karnataka, the Congress (I) is strategizing to gain power, with former Chief Minister Gundu Rao leading efforts to unite the state party. Meanwhile, opposition parties in Andhra Pradesh issued an ultimatum to the Governor, demanding an emergency assembly session to reinstate the N.T. Rama Rao Ministry, or face a nationwide bandh.

### [Ashok Gulati and Reena Singh write: How to help Haryana and Punjab move away from paddy to less water-guzzling crops](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ashok-gulati-and-reena-singh-write-how-to-help-haryana-and-punjab-move-away-from-paddy-to-less-water-guzzling-crops-9545179/)

Punjab and Haryana have initiated a scheme to encourage farmers to shift from water-intensive paddy cultivation to alternative crops. While the incentive of Rs 17,500 per hectare is a positive step, it falls short compared to the existing subsidies farmers receive for paddy.  To effectively incentivize diversification, the minimum amount should be doubled to Rs 35,000 per hectare, redirecting existing subsidies towards more sustainable crops. This approach, combined with assured Minimum Support Prices (MSP) for alternative crops, would minimize market risks for farmers and promote diversification for at least five years. The benefits of this shift include  reduced water usage, improved soil health, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and enhanced crop biodiversity.

### [Why a caste Census is not ‘harmless’](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-a-caste-census-is-not-harmless-9545205/)

Arguments for and against a caste-based Census in India are presented.  Supporters believe it will help shape policies and provide valuable data, while opponents argue it risks exacerbating social divisions and undermining national unity. The historical precedent of religious inclusion in censuses leading to societal fractures is cited as a cautionary tale. 

It is argued that caste is a largely outdated social construct with diminishing relevance in modern India, particularly among younger generations. Conducting a caste-based Census is seen as counterproductive to efforts to dismantle the caste system and create a more equitable society.  A focus on promoting a casteless society through education and social reforms is recommended instead of reinforcing caste identities through official data collection.

India's economy grew by 6.7 percent in the first quarter of the current fiscal year, lower than the Reserve Bank of India's projection of 7.1 percent.  Several factors contributed to this slowdown, including reduced government spending, weak agricultural and certain service sectors. However, the agricultural sector is expected to recover with a favorable monsoon, potentially boosting rural consumption and easing price pressures.  While manufacturing growth moderated, corporate sales and profits saw an increase. Construction and private consumption showed strong momentum, while investment held up. Government spending remained subdued due to the general elections, but a potential pick-up in the coming quarters could stimulate economic activity.

Yogendra Yadav's article "Where are our Political Thinkers?" presents an exaggerated view of the state of political thought in India. While acknowledging that modern political discourse lacks figures like Gokhale and Ranade, the article argues that political theory is alive and well in research, public commentary, and academic spaces. 

Yadav's claim that political thinking does not influence action is refuted by examples like the Right to Information Act and the abolition of Triple Talaq. The article further highlights the emergence of new perspectives in feminist, Dalit, and decolonization studies, demonstrating the dynamism of Indian political thought. 

Instead of lamenting the absence of comprehensive political explanations, the article encourages a focus on understanding the complexities of contemporary India. 
 It suggests that analyzing everyday spaces like airports can reveal valuable insights into the evolving political landscape and urges a reassessment of concepts like "hustling" as crucial to understanding Indian democracy.

The article reflects on a workshop for independent directors concerning the risks of AI. The author finds the workshop's approach limited because it relies on traditional corporate vocabulary and processes ill-suited to address the complexities of AI's disruptive potential.  

The author emphasizes the need for scenario planning that accounts for discontinuity and anticipates radical future developments driven by AI. They argue that traditional governance structures, relying on annual evaluations and homogenized board composition, are inadequate for navigating AI's transformative impact. 

Finally, the author calls for a reevaluation of corporate jargon, urging a shift  towards a more nuanced understanding of concepts like "vision," "strategy," and "governance" in the face of AI's unprecedented challenges.

The 1984 anti-Sikh violence, which resulted in the deaths of over 2,700 people in Delhi alone, remains a deeply troubling event in India's history. Despite numerous investigations and reports implicating senior Congress leaders, the pursuit of justice has been slow.  While the conviction of Sajjan Kumar in 2018 provided a measure of closure for some, many others continue to seek accountability. This week, a Delhi court ordered the CBI to file charges against another high-profile Congress leader, Jagdish Tytler, in a case linked to the violence. 

The decision follows decades of delays and contested investigations. The long-awaited step towards justice in the Tytler case highlights the enduring pain of the 1984 tragedy and the need for comprehensive accountability.

The article discusses the recent complexities in Punjab,  marked by the delayed justice for the 1984 anti-Sikh riots and the political struggles of the Shiromani Akali Dal (SAD).  

The author highlights the SAD's "punishment" of its leader, Sukhbir Badal, as a potential attempt to salvage their image amidst accusations of inaction during religious incidents, involvement with controversial groups, and failure to address the state's issues. This situation coincides with the lingering challenges of incomplete justice in the 1984 riots and the evolving political landscape in Punjab. 

The article points to the impact of the 2020 farmers' movement, which showcased public disillusionment with traditional leaders, and the subsequent rise and subsequent unraveling of the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) governance.  The article concludes by emphasizing Punjab's challenges, including unanswered questions of justice, political instability, and persistent social issues.

The Malayalam film industry is undergoing a reckoning following the release of the Hema Committee report, revealing widespread sexual harassment and exploitation.  Inspired by this movement, women from other film industries, including Bengali and Telugu, are demanding similar accountability and workplace safety. However, the Hindi film industry has yet to make a collective statement or take significant action. The article highlights the industry's history of silencing victims and perpetuating misogynistic practices, citing the #MeToo movement's limited impact. Despite some positive changes, such as increased representation of women in crew positions and stories centered on female protagonists, the lack of a strong advocacy group like the Women in Cinema Collective in Bollywood is a concerning gap. The article calls upon men in the industry to act as allies, use their platforms to support women, and create a safer environment for speaking out against abuse.

Rahul Gandhi has become a more prominent political figure, gaining recognition  as a potential successor to Narendra Modi.  His efforts in portraying himself as a man of the people have resonated with some voters, challenging Modi's image. However, Gandhi's focus on caste issues and his sometimes eccentric statements  can hinder his credibility.  Concerns arise about the return of his old "courtiers," who could undermine his progress and allow Modi to regain his footing. Gandhi needs to address this perception of insincerity and avoid dwelling excessively on caste to be taken more seriously as a political leader.

The 1962 Assembly elections in J&K,  simultaneously held with national polls, were the first conducted by the Election Commission of India.  Despite the JKNC sweeping both the 1957 and 1962 polls, these elections weren't without controversy. Opposition parties  alleged irregularities and boycotted, while others criticized the EC for not preventing malpractice.  The 1964 saw a significant political shift in J&K, with JKNC leaders joining the Congress and the Praja Parishad merging with the Bharatiya Jana Sangh.

There is a debate in India regarding pensions, particularly the shift from the Old Pension Scheme (OPS) to the New Pension Scheme (NPS). The OPS was a defined benefit scheme with a guaranteed minimum pension, while the NPS is a defined contribution scheme. 

The government argues that the OPS was unsustainable and burdensome financially. The Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) aims to address this by being a funded scheme where both the government and employees contribute, while also guaranteeing a minimum pension. However, employee unions are opposed to the employee contribution, creating a dilemma for the government.

The Supreme Court of India has taken the unusual step of initiating suo motu proceedings into the rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata. While the immediate trigger was this incident,  the court aims to examine broader issues related to workplace violence against healthcare professionals.  

The court's recognition of public protests as a "moment of national catharsis" and its empathetic stance towards protestors marks a significant shift. It also validates the importance of media reports in situations where public trust in official narratives is low. The court has distinguished between peaceful protestors and disruptive mobs, condemning the police for retreating in the face of violence against protestors.  

This case presents an opportunity to re-evaluate the legal framework surrounding protests, particularly concerning disproportionate state action against demonstrators. The court's willingness to review criminal cases against protest leaders is also encouraging.

Starbucks CEO Brian Niccol, despite the company's commitment to environmental sustainability, will travel to the Seattle headquarters in a company-owned jet three times a week. This practice contradicts the company's encouragement of using eco-friendly alternatives and highlights the disparity in environmental impact between the wealthy and the rest. 

The use of private jets for travel contributes significantly to carbon emissions, far exceeding the environmental footprint of other modes of transportation like trains or commercial planes.  This incident exposes a larger issue: the wealthiest individuals, often those at the helm of major companies, disproportionately contribute to climate change while enacting measures that appear superficially sustainable. Critics argue that these actions are  empty gestures  or attempts to influence climate policies to their advantage.

The recent student-led protests in Bangladesh that led to the resignation of Sheikh Hasina  raised concerns among Bangladeshi Hindus about their safety.  They fear that, as in the past, political upheaval might lead to attacks on minority communities. However, Bangladeshi citizens of all religions, led by the student protesters, have come together to protect minority institutions.  While demanding a secular democratic government, Bangladeshi Hindus are seeking concrete changes like a Minority Affairs Ministry and reservations in Parliament. 
However, misinformation from some Indian Hindu groups portrays Bangladeshi Hindus as helpless and dependent on authoritarian rule, further endangering them.  Instead of promoting fear and division, Indian Hindus should support the demands of their Bangladeshi counterparts for a truly inclusive and secular democracy in Bangladesh. Bangladeshi Hindus are not helpless; they are actively fighting for their rights and seeking solidarity from fellow Hindus to ensure their safety and equal citizenship in Bangladesh.

The series highlights their early struggles, their intense ambition, and the strong bond they shared. However, it falls short in analyzing their writing, which is the foundation of their legacy.  

While touching upon the success of "Sholay" and the enduring impact of "Deewaar," the documentary doesn't delve into the craft of their storytelling. It fails to examine their evolution, inspirations, or the techniques that made their scripts so impactful.

Despite this, their influence on Indian cinema is undeniable, inspiring aspiring screenwriters and bringing the script to the forefront.  Their work, though lacking social commentary, entertained audiences and left a lasting mark on the industry.

Recent talks between India and China on easing tensions in eastern Ladakh offer hope for a breakthrough.  While both sides describe the discussions as "constructive," reaching a resolution remains challenging due to differing approaches.  India insists on a return to the pre-2020 border status as a prerequisite for improved relations, while China advocates for "normalisation" while addressing border concerns separately. 

Despite these differences, both countries appear to be moving towards a negotiated settlement. The focus is now on addressing legacy issues in Depsang and Demchok. China recognizes the economic and diplomatic costs of the stand-off, and India acknowledges the limitations of maintaining strained ties. A potential agreement involves China easing military pressure and India resuming political dialogue and economic engagement. However, any deal requires transparency and public support to navigate India's internal political complexities and strong nationalist sentiments.

The Supreme Court of India is set to hear the case of Hrishikesh Sahoo v the State of Karnataka, which challenges the constitutionality of the marital rape exception (MRE).  The MRE, present in both the Indian Penal Code and the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita, allows husbands to have sex with their wives without consent.  

This exception is considered discriminatory and a violation of women's rights, as it denies them the same legal protections as unmarried women. Data suggests that marital rape is prevalent in India, with significant psychological and physical effects on victims. Opponents argue that criminalizing marital rape will harm family structures, but advocates contend that true marital harmony stems from consent and respect.  

The Supreme Court will consider whether the MRE violates Articles 14, 15, 19, and 21 of the Constitution, which guarantee equality, non-discrimination, freedom of speech, and the right to life and liberty, respectively. The decision has the potential to significantly impact women's rights in India, aligning the country with international human rights standards.

Two prominent Telugu Desam members, the Speaker and Deputy Speaker, joined the cabinet of Chief Minister N Bhaskara Rao, dealing a blow to the party. Meanwhile, Charan Singh's Lok Dal, along with dissident Janata Party factions, are forming a new political party with Charan Singh at its helm.  The new Andhra Pradesh Governor, S D Sharma, plans to invite the dismissed chief minister, N T Rama Rao, for discussions on the state's political situation.  Also, the Industrial Disputes Amendment Act, 1982, came into effect, ensuring full wages for reinstated workers during legal proceedings in higher courts.

Indigo Airlines has introduced a new option allowing women passengers to select seats next to other women. While seemingly a simple gesture, this move addresses a long-standing issue of space encroachment by men, often unintentionally, leading to discomfort for women passengers. 

The article highlights the societal conditioning that often leads to men occupying more space and the challenges faced by women navigating these situations. It praises Indigo for responding to customer feedback and proposes potential solutions for ensuring the effectiveness of the new initiative while avoiding unintended consequences. The author also cautions against hastily replicating this approach, citing examples of well-intentioned solutions that ultimately backfired.

The Supreme Court reaffirmed the principle that "bail is the rule, jail is the exception" even in cases under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). This is a significant shift from a previous ruling upholding the stringent provisions of the PMLA, amid concerns about misuse against political opponents. 

Recent judgments have introduced safeguards for the accused, such as requiring written grounds for arrests and considering prolonged pre-trial detention in bail decisions. While these steps strengthen procedural protections, the court still needs to comprehensively review its 2022 ruling on the PMLA, which potentially undermined the presumption of innocence.

Following the 2012 Delhi gang rape, numerous Members of Parliament expressed outrage and called for severe punishment for perpetrators.  They acknowledged the deep social failure that allowed such crimes to occur and emphasized the need for stronger laws and swift justice. Some called for the death penalty, while others advocated for preventive measures like educating young men about respecting women. 

Twelve years later, the issue of violence against women persists. The article cites several recent cases of horrific crimes against women and girls, emphasizing that parliamentary speeches alone are insufficient.  It calls for action, urging a commitment to turning words into tangible results.

India boasts the highest proportion of women pilots globally, demonstrating progress in gender equality within the aviation industry. However, the issue of sexual safety for women passengers remains a concern. Despite existing protocols, reports of inappropriate behavior on flights continue.  Indigo Airlines' recent "pink seats" initiative, which allows women to see the gender of fellow passengers before selecting seats, aims to address this issue but may inadvertently reinforce the idea that women are responsible for their own safety.  

True solutions require a focus on perpetrator accountability and robust training for airline staff to effectively identify and handle inappropriate behavior. Isolate men rather than women to ensure a safe and comfortable flying experience for all.

Facing a growing culture where work bleeds into personal time, several countries are enacting "right to disconnect" laws.  Australia is the latest, prohibiting employers from penalizing workers who don't respond to calls or texts outside work hours. This legislation stems from a larger movement emphasizing work-life balance and recognizes that technology has blurred the lines between work and leisure, leading to increased burnout. Studies show that well-rested and rejuvenated employees are more productive and creative, suggesting a win-win for both workers and companies.

Mamata Banerjee's response to the R G Kar rape and murder case has been criticized as rash and desperate.  Her comments, accusing the BJP of exploiting the situation, are seen as inflammatory and deflecting from the TMC government's shortcomings in handling the crisis. The government has been faulted for its initial handling, including failing to inform the family, investigating as "unnatural death," and poorly addressing the subsequent vandalism at the hospital. 

While Banerjee has called for swift justice and harsher punishments, many believe that true reform requires a more comprehensive approach rather than simply relying on stricter laws.

### [R G Kar case is not about violence against a healthcare worker — it is violence against a woman](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rg-kar-rape-murder-doctor-9540584/)

The horrific sexual violence at RG Kar hospital should be seen as a case of assault against a woman, not primarily a workplace safety issue for healthcare workers.  

 While it's important to ensure the safety of all healthcare workers, focusing solely on this diminishes the gravity of the sexual assault and shifts attention from the systemic issues of patriarchy and impunity that allow such crimes to occur.  

The incident highlights the need for a culture shift that addresses violence against women in all settings, not just hospitals.  It also underscores the importance of holding institutions accountable and strengthening legal frameworks to protect women.  


Ultimately, tackling sexual violence requires a multifaceted approach that includes addressing societal norms, promoting ethical practices in healthcare, and ensuring a safe and empowering experience for all healthcare users.

The article explores the concept of "cringe" in popular culture, using examples like Kajol's outfit in "Kuch Kuch Hota Hai" and songs by Dhinchak Pooja and Gagni Porwal.  It argues that the internet allows for a democratization of art and expression, leading to both successes and spectacular failures.  We are drawn to these "cringe" moments because they offer a form of relatable authenticity and celebrate the vulnerability of putting oneself out there. The article draws parallels between "cringe" and camp, where sincerity and exaggerated effort combine to create humor and a sense of shared experience. Ultimately, it suggests that appreciating these attempts, even if imperfect, is a valuable part of online culture and a reflection of our own human desire to connect and share.

### [A Uniform Civil Code should expand rights of women and young, not restrict them](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/uniform-civil-code-women-rights-9539655/)

Two Op-Eds arguing for Prime Minister Modi's call for a "secular civil code"  fail to clearly define what such a code would entail. Both focus on the need to reform Muslim personal law, overlooking the broader context of women's rights and the historical resistance to a uniform civil code.

The original push for a uniform civil code in the Constituent Assembly faced opposition from both Hindu and minority groups, leading to a compromise focusing on a common Hindu civil code which ultimately fell short of achieving women's rights.  

The Uttarakhand Uniform Civil Code,  which mirrors these older provisions, raises concerns about its potential to be divisive and detrimental to women's freedoms.  The code restricts interfaith marriages, criminalizes early divorce, and mandates registration of live-in relationships, leaving couples vulnerable to harassment.  A timely Supreme Court judgment is needed to establish constitutional benchmarks for a women's rights-based civil code.

### [From Salim-Javed to Kamala Harris, the fantasy of the infallible ‘Ma’](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/kamala-harris-salim-javed-mother-9539227/)

The concept of "mother" holds immense cultural significance, transcending individual experiences and shaping societal perceptions. From religious figures to cinematic portrayals, the idealized mother embodies unconditional love, sacrifice, and moral authority.  

Hindi cinema often depicts widowed or abandoned mothers as powerful figures, reflecting a cultural yearning for a nurturing, primal maternal figure.  While recent films have explored more complex mother characters, the dichotomy between "good" and "bad" mothers persists, reinforcing traditional roles.  

This idealized image of motherhood exerts influence beyond cinema, impacting political discourse where women leaders are often expected to leverage maternal qualities for legitimacy.  To challenge the status quo for women, it may require moving beyond the solely maternal narrative.

Recent Supreme Court judgments emphasize the principle of bail as the norm in cases under special laws like the UAPA and PMLA, aiming to prevent pretrial detention from becoming punitive. 

The ED's use of stringent PMLA provisions has faced scrutiny, with courts expressing concerns about its impact on individuals and due process. While the government highlights the ED's success in registering cases and attaching assets, critics point to allegations of bias against the opposition and concerns about the lengthy and often unresolved judicial processes.

Questions arise about the ED's capacity to handle the sheer volume of cases and potential for misuse of its powers. The Supreme Court's upcoming review of PMLA provisions is anticipated to address these concerns and potentially bring about necessary reforms to ensure a balance between combating financial crime and safeguarding individual rights.

This article criticizes the actions of the Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, arguing that the position has been misused to obstruct the work of the elected government. The author contends that the L-G's role should be limited to land and law and order matters, as originally intended, and that recent interference in other areas has been detrimental to the city's progress. The article highlights several instances of alleged L-G overreach, including the appointment of unfavorable bureaucrats, blocking funds for projects, and disregarding environmental regulations.  

Despite these challenges, the author points to the achievements of the Delhi government in areas like education, healthcare, and infrastructure, arguing that these successes demonstrate the need for a more collaborative relationship between the elected government and the L-G's office. The article concludes with a call to abolish the positions of L-G and governor, deeming them relics of colonialism that hinder democratic principles.

The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana has significantly expanded access to formal banking services in India.  The scheme has opened over 53 crore accounts, with a majority in rural/semi-urban areas and benefiting women disproportionately. 

This financial inclusion, coupled with Aadhaar and mobile technology, has enabled Direct Benefit Transfer (DBT) schemes, ensuring more efficient and accurate delivery of social welfare. The JAM trinity has also revolutionized payment systems through the Unified Payments Interface, facilitating millions of daily transactions, especially among low-income households.  

While the focus has been on account opening, the challenge remains to provide tailored financial products and services that cater to the specific needs of low-income individuals.  The Unified Lending Interface holds potential for serving those segments still excluded from formal financial services.

Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma sparked controversy by declaring he would "take sides" and rejecting claims by Bengali Muslims, referred to as "Miya Muslims", to  "take all of Assam".  His statements followed tensions in Sivasagar stemming from a rape incident allegedly perpetrated by Bengali Muslim youths, leading to threats against those perceived as "Bangladeshis". Sarma's rhetoric is seen as alarmingly divisive, fueling communal anxieties in a state already grappling with identity issues. 

  Bengali Muslims, referred to as "Miyas", face xenophobic attacks, often portrayed by political actors as competing with indigenous Assamese for resources and cultural dominance.  Sarma's controversial statements reflect a pattern of divisive politics that exploits existing insecurities, contradicting the Prime Minister's call for adherence to constitutional morality.

The recent election results have significantly impacted India's governance landscape. The Prime Minister's authority has suffered a decline, both domestically and in his ability to understand public sentiment. This, coupled with internal party dissension, has created a sense of vacuum at the top of the government.

The BJP is increasingly resorting to tactics that exacerbate institutional conflict, evident in their approach towards states under opposition rule and the use of inflammatory rhetoric.  

Furthermore, despite electoral setbacks, the BJP remains committed to the Hindutva agenda, further dividing the nation. Routine governance remains absent, and the government is likely to rely on welfare populism and communal mobilization to appease its base. 

The opposition is emboldened and ready to challenge the ruling party, while the judiciary, though imperfect, offers some resistance against government overreach. This volatile combination sets the stage for an unpredictable governance trajectory for India.

The article discusses the increasing violence against female caregivers in India, highlighting the complex factors contributing to this issue. It argues that societal misogyny, lack of support systems, and a changing cultural landscape, marked by a rise in toxic masculinity and a disregard for respect, are key drivers of this violence. The author emphasizes the importance of addressing the root causes by promoting gender sensitivity, peaceful conflict resolution, and empathy from a young age. 

It calls for a collective effort involving families, schools, communities, and religious leaders to create a culture of respect for women and children.  The author stresses the need for strong leadership and societal change to ensure the safety and well-being of caregivers and to foster a more compassionate future.

The Malayalam film industry is facing a crisis following allegations of sexual assault against its members. A 2017 government-appointed committee, headed by retired Justice K Hema, investigated the issue and found widespread violence against women. The committee's report, delayed in its release, shed light on the pervasive exploitation and abuse faced by women in the industry. 

The Women in Cinema Collective (WCC), formed by women actors, has been instrumental in supporting survivors and demanding accountability. Their efforts have emboldened other women to come forward, highlighting the deep-rooted misogyny within the industry. The situation has sparked a reckoning, forcing the industry to confront its culture of silence and  the need for systemic change to create a safe and equitable space for women.

Recent Supreme Court of India judgments have reemphasized the fundamental right to life and personal liberty, affirming that this right supersedes restrictive statutory provisions in penal statutes when considering bail. 

The court has stressed that bail should be the rule, with refusal being the exception. 

It has criticized lower courts for denying bail in deserving cases and highlighted the need for speedy trials. The court has also clarified that custodial interrogation is not necessary after charges have been filed, and questioned the fairness of prosecution agencies in using co-accused statements without corroboration.  Beyond bail, theSC has protected procedural rights, such as providing written grounds for arrest and ensuring timely access to legal counsel.  These decisions reflect the judiciary's commitment to individual freedom and checks on executive power, even in times of political shifts.

The author, a first-generation Indian immigrant, discusses Kamala Harris's historic potential as the first woman, Black woman, Caribbean American, and Asian American President. While celebrating Harris's nomination, she acknowledges the current climate of racial tension in the US, exacerbated by policies that target diversification. 

The author highlights the unique challenges faced by Indian Americans, who despite being a growing political force, are still subject to racial discrimination and navigate issues like H-1B visas and precarious immigration realities. She criticizes Harris's attempts to appease White voters by emphasizing her commitment to national security and separating "good" immigrants from "bad" ones. 

Despite these criticisms, the author recognizes the significance of Harris's candidacy, particularly for young people of color who see themselves reflected in her story.  She believes Harris's presidency, while not without its challenges, offers hope and inspiration for immigrants and marginalized communities.

The 2024 Lok Sabha elections resulted in a more balanced Parliament, leading to a different dynamic compared to the previous sessions. The increased Opposition strength has made it harder for the government to pass legislation without debate and has forced them to reconsider certain decisions. 

Significant improvements include a longer discussion on the Union Budget and the referral of contentious bills to Parliamentary Committees.  However, concerns remain regarding the government's transparency, as leaks of bills prior to formal circulation continue.  

Despite calls for greater inclusivity, the government has yet to fill the vacant Deputy Speaker position and has shown reluctance to allot sufficient time for Opposition-led discussions.  These actions, coupled with restricted media access to Parliament proceedings, raise concerns about the government's commitment to a truly democratic and transparent legislative process.

The recent revision of the New Pension Scheme (NPS) in India has sparked debate. While the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) aims to harmonize benefits with the Old Pension Scheme (OPS), critics argue it merely increases government expenditure on existing pensioners and fails to address the core objectives of pension reform. 

The government's focus on aligning benefits with the OPS has been criticized for favoring a small percentage of government employees while neglecting the vast majority of workers and elderly who lack access to institutional pension schemes. 

Experts emphasize the need to reallocate resources from existing pension provisions to expand worker and elderly coverage, highlighting the need for a social contract that promotes inter- and intra-generational equity in public expenditure on old age income support.

Delhi's population surge, nearing 43 million in the next decade, raises concerns about the city's infrastructure preparedness. The recent monsoon exposed severe infrastructure shortcomings, highlighting failures in managing waterlogging, sanitation, and overall civic services. The rapid growth of unauthorized colonies lacks basic amenities like roads, drainage, and sanitation.

The Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yojana (PMJDY) has significantly improved financial inclusion in India, with over 80% of adults now having a formal financial account. Launched in 2014, the scheme aimed to include unbanked households by providing basic savings bank deposit accounts. PMJDY accounts have disbursed Rs 38.49 lakh crore through direct benefit transfer (DBT) and plugged leakages worth Rs 3.48 lakh crore.  

The success of the scheme is evident in the increase in account balances, with 55.6% belonging to women, and 66.6% located in rural and semi-urban areas.  The  initiative has also led to a decrease in thefts and consumption of intoxicants in several states. Looking ahead, strengthening the financial ecosystem, expanding product penetration, enhancing consumer protection, and designing customer-centric products are key priorities.  Linking PMJDY accounts with other government schemes will further empower individuals at the bottom of the pyramid.

While acknowledging the need for some changes, the author argues that the new legislation, the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), does not adequately address the challenges of the 21st century, particularly those arising from technological advancements. 

The author points out the absence of provisions specifically dealing with cybercrime, data theft, and other offences prevalent in the digital age. They criticize the BNS for not including clear definitions and safeguards against potential misuse of powers related to  "economic security" and "economic offences."  

Furthermore, the article highlights concerns regarding the gender-neutrality of certain provisions, the criminalization of suicide attempts, and the lack of consideration for practices like hunger strikes. The author concludes by emphasizing the need for the law to evolve and adapt to the rapid advancements in technology and societal norms.

The article discusses the success of the film Kalki 2898 AD, noting its reliance on familiar tropes from the Mahabharata and Ramayana. While acknowledging the broad appeal of these epics, the author argues that this consistent retelling, particularly in simplified and regressive forms, hinders Indian cinema from developing new archetypes and voices. 

The article contrasts this approach with Hollywood, which also recycles stories but often lacks the depth of meaning found in Indian epics. It suggests that Indian cinema should learn from Hollywood's shortcomings and strive for originality, exploring more nuanced and contemporary interpretations of classic narratives. The author ultimately concludes that while these epics remain a part of Indian identity, their constant rehashing may not be beneficial for the 21st century.

The article discusses the inadequate conversation surrounding sexual violence in India. 

It highlights the tendency to focus on the graphic details of assaults, the victim's actions leading up to the incident, and the outrage that is selectively reserved for certain victims based on their social standing.  The elephant in the room,  the patriarchal culture that perpetuates these acts,  is often ignored. 

The piece further delves into the victim-blaming mentality prevalent in society, where women are held responsible for preventing assault. 

It criticizes the focus on quick justice solutions like capital punishment, arguing that it overlooks the systemic issues at play.  The article concludes by emphasizing the need to acknowledge and address the deeply ingrained patriarchy that enables sexual violence to thrive.

The author recognizes the strength and resilience required for Harris to navigate these challenges, but fears the cost this will have on her well-being.  Ultimately, she expresses hope for Harris's presidency, hoping it will lead to a more equitable future for women of color.

### [Unified Pension Scheme is a win-win for states, Centre and people](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/unified-pension-scheme-is-a-win-win-for-states-centre-and-people-9534617/)

The Maharashtra government's decision to adopt the Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) framework is a significant win for cooperative federalism.  This moves counters the trend of some states returning to the unsustainable Old Pension Scheme (OPS) as it maintains  the contributory and funded nature of pensions, ensuring long-term fiscal stability. The UPS provides certainty to pensioners while strengthening state finances, allowing them to prioritize capital expenditure and boost economic growth.  

In addition to the UPS adoption, the Centre's initiatives such as increased special assistance for capital investment and tighter regulations on off-budget borrowings demonstrate a commitment to supporting state finances and promoting transparency. These combined efforts aim to create a more robust and sustainable financial framework for both the central and state governments, ultimately benefiting citizens and enabling greater economic progress.

The article discusses the decline of political thought in modern India.  It argues that while India once had a strong tradition of political thinkers who grappled with fundamental questions about the nation's direction, this tradition has waned since the mid-20th century.  The author attributes this decline to a lack of imagination, understanding, and judgment in contemporary Indian politics.  While acknowledging exceptions, such as movements focused on feminism, social justice, and critiques of development, the article emphasizes the need for a renewed focus on robust political thought to address the challenges facing India.

Maria Branyas Morera, who lived to 117, offered simple advice for a long life: order, tranquility, family, nature, emotional stability, positivity, and avoiding toxic people.  While her longevity is remarkable, there's no scientific evidence to suggest these are universal keys to a long life.  Reaching such extreme ages is so rare that it's more about being lucky than following specific guidelines. 

The most important lesson from elders, however, is not about living long but living well.  In a society focused on consumption and accumulation, Morera's life teaches us to find happiness in the journey, not just the destination.

The upcoming US presidential election will see contrasting views on climate change between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris. While Harris positioned climate action as a “fundamental freedom” during the Democratic National Convention, Trump has focused on domestic oil production as a solution to high energy costs, framing it within economic nationalism.  

Despite campaign promises to reduce drilling, the Biden administration has faced criticism for approving oil drilling projects. Harris, who initially advocated for a fracking ban, has softened her stance. Environmentalists stress the need for significant energy sector changes to address global warming, and the election will reveal how the Harris campaign navigates this complex issue.

The release of the Justice Hema Committee report has sparked a wave of accusations of sexual misconduct within the Malayalam film industry. Prominent figures have resigned, and a special police team has been formed to investigate the allegations. This signifies a potential shift towards accountability, but the journey toward justice is long and complex. It stems from years of activism, including the 2017 Malayalam film industry assault case, the 2012 Delhi gangrape, and the 2018 MeToo movement. 

Change requires tackling power imbalances and ensuring the voices of the vulnerable are heard.  New laws and stricter punishments are needed, but addressing systemic issues that enable abuse is equally crucial.  Protecting women's dignity is a shared responsibility of society and the government.

The hijacking of an Indian Airlines Boeing 737 from Dubai ended after nearly two days, with the safe arrival of 73 passengers and six crew members in Delhi.  The hostages, held captive by seven pro-Khalistan youths, were released following Pakistan's decision to refuel the aircraft.

The Awami League faced mounting challenges in the years leading up to its significant downfall.  The Covid-19 pandemic and the Ukraine conflict led to a tightening of control by the government, isolating it from critical social and economic concerns. 

Economic mismanagement,  fueled by corruption and a failure to address institutional dysfunction, fueled public discontent.  The government's handling of social movements,  perceived as confrontational and dismissive, further exacerbated the situation.  The party's refusal to engage with dissenting voices and its suppression of internal diversity contributed to its decline.  This crisis of moral authority necessitates a fundamental restructuring of the Awami League, including a sincere apology for past mistakes and a commitment to democratic values. Rebuilding trust and credibility will be crucial for the party to regain public support and emerge as a force for positive change.

The article recounts the author's experience at the 2020 Democratic National Convention, where Kamala Harris was nominated as Joe Biden's running mate. The author, a young Indian-American woman, was struck by the historic significance of the event and Harris's nomination, noting the palpable energy and excitement in the atmosphere. 

Harris's campaign emphasized American values and her qualifications as a prosecutor and public servant, rather than her identity as a woman or person of color. The author observed that while Harris did not shy away from her racial identity, she focused on policy differences with Donald Trump. The convention was seen as a sign of a surge in momentum for the Democratic campaign, with many people feeling inspired to vote, especially young people. Ultimately, the author decided to vote for Harris because she saw her as a symbol of radical change and progress for America.

The article examines the evolution of male archetypes in Indian culture, contrasting Vikram Seth's depiction of the "cad" with the "Angry Young Man" trope popularized by Salim-Javed in Bollywood.  It argues that the "cad," despite potential flaws, embodies a more nuanced and complex masculinity, subject to both admiration and judgment. The "Angry Young Man," characterized by anger and violence, is seen as problematic for potentially excusing harmful behavior.  

The author criticizes the recent documentary on Salim-Javed for its hagiographic approach, failing to adequately address the problematic representations of women in their films. Ultimately, the article suggests that the "Cad," being subject to both desire and scrutiny from women, represents a more desirable form of masculinity compared to the potentially violent and simplistic "Angry Young Man."

Hijackers who seized an Indian Airlines plane over Pathankot surrendered in the United Arab Emirates after 38 hours, releasing all passengers and crew unharmed in exchange for passage to the United States. 

Opposition parties held "all-India protest day" demonstrations against the dismissal of the Andhra Pradesh Rama Rao ministry, resulting in some violent incidents.  The Election Commission decided to use the 1971 electoral rolls as the basis for future revisions in Assam. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi denied reports of an Indian invasion plan for Sri Lanka, stating there was no such plan then or in the future. Lastly, the government introduced the Unified Pension Scheme, guaranteeing a 50% pension for central government employees who joined service in 2004 or later.

The Indian government has introduced a new Unified Pension Scheme (UPS) for central government employees. The UPS combines elements of both the old and new pension schemes, offering a defined benefit of 50% of an employee's average basic pay upon retirement.  The government's contribution will increase to 18.5% of the employee's basic salary, while employees will continue to contribute 10%. This change is expected to increase the government's financial burden on pension payments by Rs 6,250 crore in the first year.  The UPS comes amidst a resurgence of support for the old pension scheme in several states, raising concerns about the sustainability of such a defined benefit structure for all government employees.

The article discusses the Hema Committee report on sexual harassment and exploitation in Malayalam cinema, focusing on the unique context of Kerala.  It argues that the report's revelations are not surprising given the history of patriarchal structures within the industry and the collision between traditional power dynamics and the increasing education and empowerment of women in Kerala.  

The writer emphasizes the importance of the Women in Cinema Collective's (WCC) struggle, which led to the report's formation, highlighting how educated, middle-class women in Kerala challenged the industry's feudal practices. While acknowledging the resistance to change and the limitations of government action, the article expresses hope for a transformation of societal norms in Kerala through continued discourse and activism.

India's relationship with the US has been steadily improving over the past two and a half decades, regardless of the political party in power.  The US is now India's most important partner across various sectors, from trade and technology to national security. A robust and multi-faceted engagement, including strong Congressional support and involvement from the business sector, further strengthens this bond. 

While President Biden's policies are well-known, Vice President Harris's foreign policy approach remains slightly ambiguous. However, her actions and rhetoric suggest continuity in areas crucial for India, such as immigration reform, trade, technology, and Eurasian security. Key areas of convergence, such as countering Chinese influence in Asia, are likely to continue under a Harris administration. 


Maintaining this strong relationship requires sustained effort from both sides. India should address potential disagreements proactively and work towards deepening the partnership in various domains.

The Pradhan Mantri MUDRA Yojana (PMMY) has been a significant initiative for empowering small and micro businesses in India.  The scheme has disbursed over 27.75 lakh crore to 47 crore entrepreneurs, with a high proportion going to women and marginalized groups, promoting financial inclusion and economic growth.  While successful, PMMY faces challenges such as uneven regional distribution of loans, inadequate monitoring, and financial literacy gaps among beneficiaries. This has led to higher NPAs in certain categories and hindered the scheme's full potential. 

Moving forward, MUDRA 2.0 needs to focus on strengthening outreach in rural areas, enhancing financial literacy programs, implementing a robust credit guarantee mechanism, and improving monitoring and evaluation systems.  These measures will help ensure that the benefits of the scheme reach the intended beneficiaries and contribute to sustainable economic development.

A high-level committee, headed by former President Ram Nath Kovind, has recommended simultaneous elections for the Lok Sabha and state assemblies in India. The committee, formed to suggest concrete implementation measures for simultaneous elections, analyzed public opinion, expert insights, and legal provisions. While 80% of the 21,558 responses received favored the concept, opposing parties raised concerns about marginalization of regional players and a potential shift towards a presidential form of governance.  The report proposed amendments to the Constitution, including a new article  "simultaneous elections"  would mean general elections for the Lok Sabha and all Vidhan Sabhas together, excluding Panchayat elections which would be held within 100 days.  The committee emphasized the need for a single electoral roll and acknowledged the logistical challenges and increased expenditure required for simultaneous polls.

The rape and murder of a postgraduate trainee doctor in Kolkata has sparked widespread protests and ignited a national debate on safety and security, particularly for women. 

The incident has drawn parallels to the 2012 Delhi rape case, highlighting a disturbing trend of violence against women. Political leaders, from differing parties, have expressed concern and called for stronger action against perpetrators. 

A historical figure, Dr Radha Gobinda Kar, whose  hospital the victim worked at, is also being invoked in this context, as his dedication to healthcare resonates with the protesters' demand for a better and safer Bengal. Public anger over the crime stems from a perceived breakdown in law and order and a sense that the state has failed to protect its citizens.  The protests reflect a collective yearning for change, better governance, and a society where women can live without fear.

The Hema Committee report, examining workplace issues for women in the Malayalam film industry, exposed  serious sexual harassment and widespread exploitation. However, the response to the report has been marred by apathy, sensationalism, and a focus on individual experiences rather than systemic issues. 

There is a tendency to deflect responsibility and cast doubt on the validity of women's experiences, while simultaneously suggesting they should pursue legal action despite the challenges involved. The report's damning findings highlight the need for concrete action, not mere lip service. The Kerala government, lauded for its initial steps towards gender inclusion, now faces a critical juncture: will it succumb to apathy or demonstrate the political will to implement meaningful change?

Reed Hastings, co-founder of Netflix, advocates for a highly competitive work environment based on his "Keeper Test," where employees are constantly evaluated and those deemed unworthy are swiftly let go.  This approach, while fostering freedom for high performers, creates a climate of fear and anxiety.  The system is compared to a sports team with players constantly vying for their position, and critics argue it reflects a primal "survival of the fittest" mentality within the modern workplace. Hastings' ideology, while successful for Netflix, raises concerns about the long-term impact on employee well-being and the sustainability of a workplace built on constant pressure and elimination.

In 1973, nurse Aruna Shanbaug was sexually assaulted and left in a vegetative state by a colleague at King Edward Memorial Hospital in Mumbai. The attacker, a contract sweeper, was convicted of attempted murder and robbery, but not sexual assault. 

Aruna lived in a hospital ward for 42 years until her death in 2015.  Her case highlighted the vulnerability of women health workers and sparked discussion about passive euthanasia.  

Despite Aruna's case and other incidents of violence against women in healthcare settings, concerns surrounding safety and security for women in healthcare remain largely unaddressed.

While Abhishek demands harsh punishment for the accused, Mamata faced criticism for her handling of the case, including alleged attempts to protect a tainted former principal. Tensions within the ruling Trinamool Congress party have heightened following the incident.  In unrelated news, the ousting of former Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina from power has led to India hosting her in a state of limbo.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 11th consecutive Independence Day speech, his longest yet,  focused on India's progress but also drew criticism for targeting a segment of the population. Modi labeled those who oppose the nation's development as having a "perverse mindset," raising concerns about his tone vis-a-vis democratic dissent. 

The speech also reiterated support for the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) and One Nation, One Election (ONOE), sparking debate. The PM characterized existing personal law codes as "communal," a statement seen by some as biased and lacking understanding of the nuances involved.  He called for a "secular civil code,"  a goal that requires extensive consultations and careful consideration. 
 
 Modi's speech remained divisive, continuing with rhetoric targeting the Congress party and raising concerns about potential further division through policies like the UCC and ONOE.  The speech's inflammatory language fueled fears that the government might push through legislation that could exacerbate societal rifts.

Recent floods in eastern Bangladesh, affecting hundreds of thousands and causing casualties, have sparked debate about  India’s role. While India denies opening its Dumbur dam, contributing to the flooding, some Bangladeshi publications see it as a factor.  The focus, however, remains on relief efforts and helping those affected by the disaster.

Prime Minister Modi's visit to Ukraine reflects India's intricate balancing act between its desire for peace and its strategic ties with Russia.  While affirming its commitment to international law and a peaceful resolution, India appears hesitant to adopt measures that would significantly antagonize Russia, such as halting oil imports.  

This approach echoes India's stance during the Soviet-Afghan War, where the US pushed for India's influence on Russia but ultimately restricted India's role in shaping the post-withdrawal scenario.  

The current situation presents a similar dilemma for India as the geopolitical landscape is shaped by competing interests between the US-led West and China-Russia alliance.  While PM Modi emphasizes dialogue and innovative solutions, Ukraine's expectations for a more assertive Indian role remain unclear.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Ukraine highlighted India's commitment to peace and diplomacy in the conflict.  

While India publicly supports international law and territorial integrity, its pragmatism is evident in its willingness to engage all stakeholders to find practical solutions for peace. India's position is complex, balancing its historical ties with Russia and its desire to uphold global order.  

While Western powers and Ukraine may want India to exert more pressure on Russia, there is no indication that they seek a significant Indian intervention. Nonetheless, India's role as a global player is evolving, and its efforts to mediate the conflict could contribute to finding a lasting solution.  

The visit marks a step forward in India-Ukraine relations, which have historically been strained, but presents challenges in navigating the geopolitical complexities of the conflict.

Prime Minister Modi's visit to Kyiv marks a significant shift in India's foreign policy by rebalancing its relations with Russia and Ukraine.  India's previous avoidance of high-level engagement with post-Soviet Ukraine and Central European countries has ended, signalling a departure from past deference to Russia. Modi's visit to Kyiv signifies a correction to India's approach regarding the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Notably, India has spoken out against Russia's actions, emphasized its commitment to territorial sovereignty, and expressed empathy for the Ukrainian people.

This rebalancing does not diminish India's relationship with Russia but rather elevates its engagement with Ukraine and Central Europe. India's reorientation is a clear indication that 21st-century realities will guide its European policies, moving away from 20th-century ideological constraints.

A recent rape and murder of a trainee doctor in Kolkata has sparked outrage and protests in India and Pakistan, highlighting the pervasive issue of violence against women, particularly in the medical field.  Female doctors face a lack of safety measures and often experience harassment and intimidation from patients and their attendants.  

Similar incidents have occurred in Pakistan,  leading to calls for better protection and an end to the misogynistic attitudes that contribute to these crimes.  Protests and online campaigns emphasize the need for a societal shift to create safe workplaces for women.  While laws exist against sexual assault, the problem persists due to societal norms, lack of reporting, and inadequate enforcement.  Addressing the root cause of this violence, the desire for power and control over women, is crucial to ensuring a future where women, including doctors, can work and live without fear.

The article argues that the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) recent regulatory measures aimed at managing the Indian rupee's volatility are misguided. It contends that currency fluctuations are a natural market response and that using regulations for currency control introduces uncertainty and increases business costs.  Three examples are given: prohibiting speculative trading in rupee-linked derivatives, regulating offshore trading platforms, and instructing banks on trading positions.  The authors believe these actions damage market liquidity, hinder trading, and undermine the RBI's primary role of ensuring financial system stability. They advocate for a market-driven approach to exchange rate management instead.

Jammu and Kashmir is set to hold its first assembly elections since becoming a Union Territory in 2019. The elections, spanning three phases, will see major political players including national parties like the BJP and Congress, and regional parties like the NC and PDP vying for power. 

The BJP holds a strong presence in the Jammu region, while the NC hopes to regain its influence in the Kashmir Valley. The emergence of a pro-separatist outfit, the Awami Ittehad Party (AIP), led by Engineer Rashid, adds another dimension to the political landscape. 

The NC's election manifesto, focusing on the restoration of Article 370 and the release of detainees, has sparked controversy, drawing criticism for its alleged separatist agenda and disregard for Jammu's marginalized communities. The elections are expected to be closely contested, with the outcome potentially shaping the future of the region.

Recent years have seen a push for a more equitable global tax system.  After the global financial crisis, the OECD spearheaded an initiative that included  15 action points to address  profit-shifting by multinationals.  However, disagreements emerged around the allocation of taxing rights for large tech companies. This led to frustration among developing nations and ultimately a call for a UN-led global tax convention. Despite resistance from developed countries like the US and UK, 125 nations, including India, voted in favor of the convention. The UN has now released a draft convention, which aims to address tax avoidance and evasion, particularly by high-net-worth individuals While promoting sovereignty, it also seeks a fair allocation of taxing rights. However, the success of the UN-led initiative hinges on its ability to overcome both logistical challenges, such as duplicate efforts, and political hurdles, including divergent economic interests.

### [Time to reset the GST system](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/time-to-reset-the-gst-system-9529971/)

While GST revenues have been robust, many states oppose changing the five existing tax slabs. However, experts argue that when collections are strong, it's the perfect time to rationalize rates.  This includes reducing the number of slabs and reviewing the items under each one.  The current system is confusing and unfair, with discrepancies in rates for similar products like cement, milk, and edible oils.  Simplifying the slabs would promote economic growth and ultimately lead to higher tax revenues. States should also explore non-tax revenue sources like user charges and property registrations to boost the economy.

The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of building expertise in underrepresented groups and fostering a culture of service above all else within the government.

While grief undeniably impacts all living beings, the animal kingdom also offers valuable lessons in navigating its complexities and finding strength in the face of loss.

Kamala Harris's nomination as the Democratic presidential candidate was met with enthusiasm, seen as a beacon of hope after four years of political turmoil. Her campaign has emphasized her competence and compassion, drawing parallels to a religious fervor. However, her acceptance speech veered towards demonizing former President Donald Trump, employing a "bogeyman" approach that risks alienating potential voters. While the Democrats attempt to frame Harris as a unifier, concerns remain about their ability to address social issues effectively. The election promises to be a closely fought battle, with both parties striving to connect with the anxieties and aspirations of American voters.

Heavy rainfall in Tripura has resulted in widespread flooding, claiming the lives of at least 10 people and displacing over 50,000. Rivers overflowing their banks have caused significant damage, particularly in the southern districts.

Gagni Porwal's song "Lovebomber baby," a heartfelt expression about a painful romantic experience, has unexpectedly become a viral sensation. What sets Porwal apart from past examples of viral "cringe" content, like Rebecca Black's "Friday," is the lack of malicious glee. Porwal's success might be attributed to the relatability of her story, as heartbreak is a universal experience. Additionally, her song offers a message of hope, demonstrating that even without a polished production or mainstream recognition, it's possible to create impactful art from personal experiences.

The Supreme Court's recent decision denying permission to remove a feeding tube from a patient in a vegetative state has sparked controversy regarding euthanasia in India.  While the court distinguishes between withholding life-prolonging measures in terminal cases and euthanasia, the decision raises ethical questions. Critics argue that prolonging life with no chance of recovery causes suffering for both the patient and their caregivers, and raises concerns about judges making medical decisions. The case highlights the need for legal clarity on end-of-life care in India, involving medical and ethical experts, and promoting open discussions about death and dying.

Minister Piyush Goyal raised concerns about predatory pricing practices by e-commerce platforms in India, highlighting the potential impact on small retailers.  While investigations have been conducted against platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, Shopee, and Ola, determining predatory pricing can be complex. A report by the Pahle India Foundation suggests that e-commerce, despite rapid growth, accounted for only 7.8% of total retail sales in 2022 and has created jobs and boosted sales for many vendors. The report also found that consumers benefit from increased choice and competitive pricing.  The Competition Commission should ensure fair play, transparency, and protection of competition in the growing e-commerce market.

Indian businesses are increasingly investing overseas, but often lack adequate assessment of political risk. Past incidents, like Tata's abandoned Bangladesh project and Adani's Sri Lanka troubles, highlight vulnerabilities. 

While Prime Minister Modi encourages global expansion, Indian firms rely heavily on personal connections and "political protection" rather than comprehensive risk analysis. This dependence on external factors, including government intervention, creates its own political risk.

Despite funding research institutions, Indian think tanks often focus on national security and foreign policy rather than country-specific economic and political risks. The lack of

investment in area studies and local expertise leaves businesses vulnerable to unforeseen political developments.  

A stronger emphasis on analyzing domestic politics and policies of target countries is essential for mitigating risks and ensuring successful overseas investment.

### [When PM Modi meets President Zelenskyy](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pm-modi-meets-president-zelenskyy-9527618/)

Prime Minister Modi's visit to Ukraine is a delicate move aimed at balancing India's relationships with Russia, China, and the West.  

Following a trip to Moscow that disappointed Western allies, Modi's visit to Kyiv seeks to restore India's image as a peaceful and principled player on the world stage. While India will likely call for peace dialogue, it is not expected to act as a mediator in the war. 

The visit presents opportunities to rekindle cooperation in areas like defense, technology, and energy. India and Ukraine share historical ties, despite past disagreements, and the war has created new avenues for collaboration. Ukraine needs to rebuild its defense industry, while India seeks to modernize its own arsenal by transitioning away from Soviet-era equipment.  
 
 Both countries are leaders in digital innovation, offering potential for cooperation in e-governance. The visit is a chance for India and Ukraine to forge a stronger partnership as they navigate the complexities of the current global landscape.

### [When a woman walks alone at night](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/when-woman-walks-alone-night-9527418/)

This article discusses the safety and mobility of women in cities, particularly highlighting the experiences of women in Delhi. The author recounts her personal experience as a young woman navigating the city and the changes in her behavior after dark.  She then describes the origin of safety audits conducted by women to assess safety concerns in public spaces and the subsequent advocacy work that led to various interventions aimed at improving women's safety.  

The article acknowledges the fear and limitations imposed on women due to violence and harassment, but emphasizes their continued determination to claim their right to public space and city life.  It uses the recent rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata as a stark example, demanding justice and systemic changes to ensure all women can live with dignity. The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of a new urban vision that prioritizes the needs and safety of women.

### [Centre’s lateral entry policy corrects a historical wrong](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/institutionalisation-lateral-entries-congress-9527403/)

The article argues that the Congress party's criticism of lateral entries in the bureaucracy is disingenuous and a tactic to deflect from its own past actions. 

It points out that the Congress has a history of making ad-hoc lateral appointments, often based on personal connections rather than merit, and that these appointments frequently lacked regard for social justice principles.  The article cites examples of Congress-era lateral entries, including those of prominent figures like Manmohan Singh and Nandan Nilekani, contrasting them with the Modi government's  emphasis on  ensuring  lateral entries  uphold  social justice and historical corrective measures. The writer suggests that the Congress is using the issue of lateral entries to gain political mileage, especially in light of their recent electoral losses.

"Stree 2: Sarkate Ka Aatank," a sequel to the 2018 successful horror-comedy, has exceeded expectations by crossing Rs 400 crore in its first week worldwide. The film capitalizes on audience familiarity with the world of Chanderi, where men are terrorized by a spirit, and delivers on the promise of action, humor, and spooky elements. Released at an advantageous time coinciding with a long weekend, it outperformed several big-budget movies earlier this year. The film highlights the importance of good storytelling and "rooted content" in attracting audiences, reminding the industry that entertaining stories with a unique perspective are what truly resonate.  While "Stree 2" leans towards humor and spectacle, it raises the question of whether future installments in the franchise will retain the social commentary and feminist themes present in the first film.

N T Rama Rao met with President Zail Singh and demanded the Governor's removal, the Bhaskara Rao ministry's dismissal, and his government's reinstatement. Opposition parties denounced the government's actions, while the government announced plans to create a new National Security Guard force to address extremist and terrorist activities.

We are experiencing an ironic "age of content" where an overwhelming abundance of material creates a sense of boredom. Research suggests that this isn't due to the quality of content, but rather our own behavior. The constant ability to switch between options and reject things instantly prevents true engagement and immersion.  We become victims of our own choices, influenced by the algorithms that profit from our short attention spans and endless scrolling. This cycle reinforces a culture of instant gratification and undermines the ability to fully appreciate any given piece of content.

The recent divergence between bank deposit and credit growth, with credit growth exceeding deposit growth, has raised concerns among policymakers.  The gap has led to banks relying more on short-term, non-retail deposits, which could lead to liquidity issues.  This trend is attributed to competitive investment avenues attracting household funds.  

The situation might intensify competition for deposits among banks, potentially driving up funding costs and impacting profitability.  It's been observed that banks are exploring innovative deposit schemes to attract funds. Credit offtake has been moderating, suggesting a possible alignment between credit growth and deposit growth. The RBI anticipates this trend to persist, although the duration is uncertain.

India's large and growing middle class makes it a lucrative target for multinational corporations.  Despite claims that Indians are price-sensitive,  the success of multiplex chains like PVR demonstrates a willingness to pay more for enhanced entertainment experiences.  

However, the recent tariff hike for mobile services by Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone, though still low compared to other nations, raises questions about price sensitivity in the telecom sector. While low prices have fueled  market disruption and consumer loyalty, the hike might prompt a reevaluation of the perceived value of service quality.

Prime Minister Modi's visit to Kyiv is a significant step for India, aiming to shape its engagement with Central Europe independent of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 

India’s long-standing relationship with Russia, particularly from the Cold War era, influences its stance on the ongoing war. However,  India is increasingly recognizing the need to pursue its own interests and de-hyphenate its ties with Russia from those with Europe. 

Modi's visit is not about "compensating" for a recent trip to Russia but rather about fostering good relations with both countries. While India's role in peace talks is limited, the focus is on strengthening bilateral cooperation and discussing perspectives on resolving the conflict peacefully.

### [Why laws on sexual violence continue to be skewed against women](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sexual-violences-law-women-9526341/)

A recent rape and murder case in Kolkata highlighted the deep-rooted issue of sexual impunity in India. Despite legislative changes aimed at addressing gender justice, including the renumbering of the penal code and the introduction of the death penalty for rape, crimes against women remain rampant.  

These changes have failed to create a culture of deterrence, and the state continues to fall short in providing adequate support and safety for women. Resources are allocated towards male-centric forensics while neglecting basic necessities for survivors, like providing them with items necessary after their clothes are taken for analysis. 

The criminalization of protest and the de-funding of women's organizations further exacerbate the problem. The societal response is often fueled by patriarchal bias and exposes the selective and partisan nature of the justice system. The reliance on carceral approaches and the persistence of negative stereotypes surrounding rape perpetuate a cycle of violence and impunity.

The article criticizes the recent UPSC advertisement for lateral entry into government positions, arguing that the lack of reservation provisions perpetuates social inequality and marginalizes Dalits and ST communities. It contends that meritocratic ideals don't address systemic biases that disadvantage these groups, leading to their exclusion from decision-making bodies. The author calls for a more inclusive and equitable approach, urging for a review of the reservation policy and  transparent recruitment processes. They emphasize the importance of representation from marginalized communities to ensure diverse perspectives and counter the hegemonic dominance of certain social groups.

Questions asked in Parliament are increasingly being rejected under various pretexts, such as "sensitive nature" or "hypothetical propositions." This trend contradicts the historical practice of allowing a wider range of questions. 

The government's unwillingness to disclose information about the cost of the new Parliament building, internet shutdown orders, petroleum imports, and even the delay in conducting Census 2021 raises concerns about transparency. 

Furthermore, the quality of answers provided has also declined, often resorting to evasiveness and semantic gymnastics. This decline in parliamentary discourse weakens the ability of MPs to effectively scrutinize the executive branch, ultimately undermining democratic governance.

The article discusses the recent murder of a medical trainee at R G Kar Medical College and Hospital in Calcutta, highlighting the deeply concerning issues of violence and systemic failures within the institution.  The author recalls past experiences of the hospital's squalid conditions and the broken sense of community among students.  This tragic event is placed within a larger context of anxieties surrounding education and competition for secure positions in India. The author cites instances of drowning deaths in a Delhi coaching center and the NEET question leak fiasco, pointing to the immense pressure and vulnerability of young aspirants for a better future. The article concludes by questioning the very purpose of education and training in a system where even those pursuing noble professions are unsafe, urging readers to consider the grim realities faced by aspiring doctors, engineers, and civil servants in India.

Despite his impressive record as a captain and coach in the IPL, his team suffered an unexpected ODI series loss to Sri Lanka. Gambhir, known for his intensity and egalitarian approach, faces the challenge of leading a team in a rebuilding phase, nurturing young talent, and managing the expectations of a demanding fan base.

The Indian government is grappling with perceptions of administrative inadequacy and exploring lateral entry from the private sector to address it. However, the article argues that this approach is misplaced. While lateral entry can be effective for specific, well-defined objectives, it's not a solution for the broader systemic issues within the civil service. 

The author contends that the core problem lies in the rigid, bureaucratic nature of the system itself, not the individuals serving within it.  They advocate for a fundamental shift in approach, drawing inspiration from models adopted by countries like Australia and New Zealand, while emphasizing the need for political ownership and coordination at both the national and state levels.

The Justice Hema Committee report, released after four years, exposes the harsh reality of the Malayalam film industry for women. The report details instances of sexual harassment, lack of basic facilities, unfair remuneration, and threats. While it marks a significant step in acknowledging the issues, the report calls for more substantial action.  

Recommendations include enacting a law specific to women's concerns in the industry and establishing a dedicated tribunal to address their complaints. However, the report emphasizes the need for a fundamental shift in the industry's culture to effectively combat deeply entrenched sexism and power imbalances. It urges the industry to move beyond progressive content in films and implement real changes to ensure a safe and equitable work environment for all.

The recent cancellation of a lateral entry advertisement for 45 mid-level specialists by the Modi government, following controversies and criticism, highlights a trend of government backtracking on certain initiatives. While lateral entry has been advocated for bringing in fresh ideas and expertise, the government faced pushback concerning its potential to undermine reservation policies, particularly in light of recent electoral concerns. 

This incident underscores the need for the government to balance the demands for expertise with the principles of social justice.  The Modi government, with its reduced majority, needs to demonstrate a willingness to listen to dissenting voices, both from within its coalition and the opposition, to ensure better decision-making and more responsive policies.

The article argues that while laws regarding rape have been strengthened, the true issue lies in the lax treatment of other crimes against women. Dowry deaths, domestic violence, stalking, and harassment are often under-reported and inadequately punished, leading to a culture where violence against women is tolerated. The author highlights the shockingly low conviction rates in dowry death cases and the lenient bail norms for offenses like domestic violence. 

They emphasize the need for a comprehensive review of laws and judicial procedures to reflect the gravity of these crimes.  Stronger penalties, a stricter bail regime, and a fast-track justice system are crucial to deterring violence and instilling fear of the law. Until then, women will remain vulnerable and abusers emboldened.

### [‘Productive’ sleeping: Dream a little dream](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/productive-sleeping-dream-a-little-dream-9524394/)

Aldous Huxley's call to "dream pragmatically" is being challenged by modern science, particularly in California, where companies are exploring lucid dreaming for productivity enhancement. 

Lucid dreaming, the ability to be aware and control dreams, has a long history and is estimated to be experienced by half the population. While some have sought to harness its creative potential, recent projects aim to turn it into a tool for learning, knowledge acquisition, and even remote control of devices. 

This commodification of dreams raises ethical concerns, blurring the line between the mystical and the mundane, and potentially diminishing the inherent inspiration and creativity of the dreaming mind.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Poland and Ukraine signifies India's growing interest in strengthening its ties with Central Europe.

This trip marks the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Poland since 1979 and to Ukraine since its independence.  It highlights Delhi's recognition of the region's strategic importance in the current geopolitical landscape, particularly given the ongoing war in Ukraine. 

India aims to build long-term partnerships with Poland and Ukraine, viewing its engagement with Central Europe as complementary to its relationship with Russia. 

The visits underscore India's broader strategy of elevating its diplomatic engagement with Europe, expanding beyond traditional ties with major European powers to include closer collaboration with Central European nations.   This shift is driven by factors such as Poland's economic growth and strategic location, and Ukraine's potential for post-war reconstruction.

### [Supreme Court verdict on sub-classification of SCs, STs is blinkered to historical discrimination of Dalits](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/supreme-court-verdict-sub-classification-sc-st-dalits-9523850/)

The Supreme Court's recent verdict on sub-categorization within reservation policies, while seemingly addressing the needs of vulnerable groups, may exacerbate social tensions among Dalits. Despite the state's claims of safeguarding marginalized communities, reservation policies have failed to achieve true diversity in institutions. The implementation of these policies is flawed, with reserved posts often remaining vacant.  

The Court's focus on economic mobility through reservations overlooks the pervasive social discrimination and violence faced by Dalits. It also fails to acknowledge the shrinking public sector and the dominant role of capitalism, which has largely excluded Dalits, Adivasis, and OBCs from economic development.  

A more effective approach would involve diversifying the economy to empower these communities as business leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators, ensuring they are stakeholders in India's growth.

### [Who is behind the violence in Bangladesh? It’s unlikely to be the students](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/violence-in-bangladesh-unlikely-students-9523696/)

The situation in Bangladesh following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has been described as chaotic.  The violence that erupted mirrors the events leading to the 1971 Liberation War, targeting members of the Awami League, religious minorities, and secular intellectuals.  

While student protests initially sparked the unrest, there is suspicion that Islamist groups, potentially including Jamaat-e-Islami, are orchestrating the violence, receiving support from external actors.  The destruction of landmarks associated with the 1971 Liberation War raises concerns about the preservation of Bangladesh's history and principles.

India,  worried about the unfolding events and potential threats to its security interests, has withdrawn non-essential staff from Bangladesh and suspended visa operations. 
 
The situation remains uncertain with calls for judicial investigations into the violence and speculation about constitutional changes and a potential new Army Chief.

### [After Wayanad, time to empower common people to claim their rightful inheritance](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/wayanad-time-empower-common-people-claim-rightful-inheritance-9523710/)

Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence found resonance in India's fight against environmental degradation. Landslides fueled by quarrying and construction are devastating communities, prompting calls for action. The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel's report, highlighting these issues, faced resistance but also generated public support. 

A successful people's movement in Chemban Mudi demonstrates the power of collective action. Advances in technology, particularly smartphones, empower commoners to advocate for their rights. The author proposes several steps for improving environmental sustainability and community well-being in Wayanad and other affected regions. These include localizing quarry management, prioritizing tribal-led homestays over tourist resorts, and establishing labor cooperatives for tea estates.  The author also advocates for revisiting Wildlife Protection Act regulations to ensure better protection of human lives and property.

### [Secular Civil Code will unify, not divide Indians](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/secular-civil-code-will-unify-not-divide-indians-9522698/)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for a Secular Civil Code (SCC) during India's Independence Day speech has reignited debate. The SCC aims to unify the nation under a single legal framework for civil matters, ensuring equality for all citizens regardless of religion. 

Opponents argue it threatens religious freedom, but proponents emphasize that true secularism lies in equal treatment under the law. They point to discriminatory aspects of existing personal laws, particularly towards women, and cite examples of other democracies with successful SCC implementations. 

The SCC is seen as a step towards modernizing India's legal system, simplifying its framework, and reducing the burden on the judiciary. Supporters view it as a constitutional duty and a moral imperative for achieving social justice and fulfilling the vision of equality enshrined in the Indian Constitution.

India faces a multitude of challenges in governing its diverse population. While secularism, intended to ensure equality for all religions, has been met with resistance from some Hindus promoting "Hindutva,"  a stricter version of Hinduism. This emphasis on Hindu identity creates insecurity, reminiscent of Israel, surrounded by non-Jewish populations.

Furthermore, India grapples with deep-rooted caste divisions, economic disparity, and a growing youth population needing employment. The widening gap between the wealthy and the working class fuels social unrest, as “bread-and-butter economics” supersede GDP growth in public concern.  

India's future hinges on addressing these issues, moving beyond divisive rhetoric and prioritizing the needs of its citizens, particularly the working class, to ensure a secure and prosperous future.

This article critiques the politicisation of a rape and murder case in Kolkata.  It argues that while public outrage and calls for justice are understandable, such cases often become entangled with political agendas, ultimately reducing the victim to a political tool. 

The author points to the limitations of protest movements, highlighting their episodic nature, urban focus, and tendency to be overshadowed by  complex societal issues.  They contend that  the absence of tangible reforms in law enforcement and the judiciary prevents these movements from achieving lasting change. 

Furthermore, the article criticizes the West Bengal government's handling of the case, accusing them of avoiding responsibility, suppressing dissent, and prioritizing political expediency over the pursuit of justice. Ultimately, the author laments the pervasiveness of political instrumentalization of such sensitive crimes, emphasizing the enduring stain it leaves on society's collective conscience.

The article discusses the unusual unity displayed by fans of rival Kolkata football clubs, East Bengal and Mohun Bagan,  during a protest against the rape and murder of a young doctor. 

The rivalry between the clubs is deeply rooted in the history of Bengal and the divide between communities. However, in this instance, the shared sense of outrage and desire for justice united them. 

This act of solidarity highlights the power of collective action, demonstrating that seemingly insurmountable differences can be overcome when a common cause is pursued.  The author uses this example to illustrate the universal right to fight for justice, regardless of background or affiliation.

Kamala Harris has unexpectedly become the Democratic Party's presidential nominee after Biden's withdrawal. Despite facing challenges due to her performance in the 2020 primaries, Harris has gained momentum and is currently tied with or leading Trump in polls.  Democrats are hoping she can rally young and minority voters and counter the Republican attacks on their economic policies.  

However, the ongoing conflict in Gaza presents a significant challenge for the Harris campaign.  Protests against US support for Israel are expected at the Democratic National Convention, and growing dissatisfaction among some Democratic voters could impact the election.

### [Yogendra Yadav writes: Where are our political thinkers?](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/yogendra-yadav-writes-where-are-our-political-thinkers-9522697/)

This article argues that modern Indian political thought has declined, leading to a stagnation in political vision and action. 

The author points to a rich tradition of political thinkers in post-independence India who were deeply engaged in shaping the nation's future. However, this tradition gradually faded away, leaving a void in political discourse. While intellectuals still exist, their work is often disconnected from practical politics.  

The result, the author claims, is a diminished capacity for political imagination and a lack of compelling alternatives to the dominant political paradigm. Reclaiming the spirit of Indian political thought is presented as crucial for revitalizing Indian democracy.

Governor Jagmohan dismissed Farooq Abdullah's ministry in Jammu and Kashmir due to the withdrawal of support by 13 National Conference MLAs. The Governor swore in G M Shah's ministry.  The central government faces a dilemma regarding the dismissal of Andhra Pradesh chief minister N T Rama Rao, as he is set to demonstrate his majority before the President amidst deteriorating law and order in the state.

India recently successfully launched its Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV), a smaller, more agile rocket designed to carry smaller satellites. This event is significant because it opens up space access to universities, startups and individual innovators, diversifying the space sector beyond traditional players like ISRO and NASA.  

SSLV's rapid assembly time and lower cost make it ideal for the growing market of small satellites used in various sectors including weather forecasting, communications, and disaster management.  India aims to increase its share in the global space economy, currently at 2%, to 8% by 2033 through initiatives like SSLV and private sector involvement.

### [Outrage over reform in capital gains tax is overblown. Here’s why](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/capital-gains-tax-reform-outrage-overblown-explained-9522238/)

The Union Budget 2024-25 has sparked debate due to changes in capital gains tax, particularly the removal of inflation indexation  benefits for property sales. While these changes appear stringent, a comparative analysis reveals that India's capital gains tax regime remains relatively moderate compared to other G20 nations. 

The budget simplifies existing provisions by unifying holding periods for short-term and long-term capital gains, increasing the short-term capital gains tax rate, and introducing a flat long-term capital gains tax rate.  The removal of indexation aligns with international practices, with few countries currently offering this benefit.  

The reforms aim to create a simpler, more equitable tax structure, discouraging speculative trading and promoting long-term investments. The increased exemption limit for lower and middle-income groups aims to make the tax system more progressive. Although there may be short-term challenges, these changes have the potential to foster a more robust and fairer economic environment in the long run.

The article examines the public response to the rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata, highlighting the need for a critical analysis of the discourse surrounding such incidents. 

It argues that focusing solely on punishing the perpetrators ignores the systemic factors that enable and protect them. The article criticizes the failure of institutions to provide safety, the media's disregard for victim anonymity, and the government's suppression of dissent. 

It emphasizes the importance of questioning societal norms and structures that perpetuate gender-based violence and silence survivors. The writer stresses the need for sustained activism and political engagement to bring about meaningful change.

India's 78th Independence Day calls for reflection on achieved milestones and areas needing improvement to reach the goal of Viksit Bharat by 2047.  While India has made strides in food security since independence, China's rapid economic growth presents both opportunities and challenges. China's success in agriculture, driven by reforms and targeted support for farmers, has significantly boosted its per capita income. India can learn from China's approach, particularly in incentivizing production of pulses, which are both nutritious and environmentally friendly.  Addressing the challenge of nutritional security remains crucial, with efforts needed to improve the well-being of young children.  Further investments in research, irrigation, and value chain development are essential for ensuring sustainable food security in the face of climate change.

An all-party action committee in Andhra Pradesh is planning to demonstrate support for former Chief Minister N.T. Rama Rao and expose the alleged unconstitutional dismissal of his ministry.  They aim to have the current government led by N. Bhaskara Rao removed and Rama Rao reinstalled. The death toll from police firing on protests against the dismissal has risen to 17.

The Supreme Court ruled that states have the power to levy royalties on mining activities, overturning a previous 1989 judgment.  

The court applied this ruling retrospectively to 2004, the date of a separate ruling that signaled a potential change in policy. While this was done to clarify legal confusion, it has raised concerns about retrospective taxation. 

The court clarified that this isn't technically retrospective taxation as it upholds a legal position that was always viable, even if not recognized. States are now empowered to collect royalties from mining companies, leading to financial implications for the industry. This situation highlights the need for stable policy environments and the importance of  policymakers ensuring a balanced approach to mineral development within the federal system.

The recent conversation between Prime Minister Modi and Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh's chief advisor, highlights the importance of the India-Bangladesh relationship.  Both sides expressed willingness to move past past tensions and focus on shared goals like development and stability. While concerns remain in Delhi about the new government's legitimacy, there's a shared understanding of the need for cooperation.  

Both countries must be cautious in navigating this delicate period. India should encourage former Prime Minister Hasina to refrain from political activities on Indian soil, while Bangladesh should avoid extradition attempts that could strain relations. 


The stability of Bangladesh hinges on its ability to achieve internal reconciliation and address its contested history.  India's support for Yunus, the new government's leader, is crucial in mitigating the risk of further instability and violence.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 11th Independence Day speech lacked the groundbreaking pronouncements that characterized his initial addresses. 

In contrast to his 2014 speech, which addressed sanitation and female empowerment with a direct and personal touch, this year's address felt more restrained.  The absence of a compelling "outreach moment" may reflect a loss of confidence due to recent electoral setbacks and a realization that key promises, like improved sanitation and reduced violence against women, remain largely unfulfilled. The speech focused on broader aspirations, such as a developed India by 2047, and addressed the controversial Uniform Civil Code, albeit cautiously, emphasizing a "secular" approach and the need for public discourse.

The article discusses the contentious issue of religious conversion in India. It argues that while the right to freedom of religion is enshrined in the Constitution, the issue of conversion remains a source of tension, particularly with the enactment of stricter anti-conversion laws.  

The author challenges the effectiveness of these laws and questions whether they truly address the root causes of conversion, which often involve socioeconomic factors. They argue that the laws create an environment of mistrust and can fuel communal conflict. 

The article concludes by invoking Mahatma Gandhi's vision of a tolerant and pluralistic India where religions coexist peacefully, urging a move away from legislation that impinges on individual religious freedom.

The recent murder of a resident doctor in Kolkata highlights the urgent need for nationwide legislation to protect healthcare workers in India.  Violence against doctors and other healthcare personnel has been increasing, leading to widespread calls for a central law. Although a draft bill was proposed, it was withdrawn due to concerns about similar requests from other professions. Healthcare workers face unique risks due to their constant interaction with the public, often during times of stress and emotional vulnerability. Several states have enacted their own laws, but a lack of uniformity creates loopholes and inconsistencies. Protections are crucial, not just during emergencies like pandemics, but for everyday safety. Healthcare workers are merely seeking the security necessary to perform their duties effectively and serve the public without fear. It is time for lawmakers and the public to recognize their vital role and support legislation that safeguards them.

A surge in suicides among medical students has prompted the National Medical Commission to address the alarming mental health crisis in the medical field. Surveys reveal high rates of mental health conditions and suicidal thoughts among students, highlighting the urgent need for policy interventions. While existing policies aim to prioritize mental health, implementation remains a challenge due to limited resources and a lack of clarity on strategies.  

India's experience combating HIV-AIDS offers valuable lessons for tackling mental health challenges.  Successful implementation of the National Aids Control Programme involved creating evidence-based interventions, engaging diverse stakeholders, addressing systemic issues, and prioritizing community-led approaches.  

Emulating these strategies, the government needs to invest in robust mental health infrastructure, implement community-based interventions, and ensure accessible and affordable care for all. Civil society plays a crucial role by providing research and evidence-based models for successful rehabilitation and care.

The Supreme Court's decision to allow sub-classification within Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) reservations has sparked debate. While there is consensus against applying a "creamy layer" exclusion to SCs and STs,  views on sub-classification are divided. Critics argue it will fragment the "pan-Dalit identity" and  highlight the limited impact of reservation, urging its effective implementation instead.  However, proponents argue that sub-classification is necessary to address the vast socio-economic disparities within SC communities and ensure that the most marginalized benefit from reservation. The demand for sub-classification stems from observations that welfare benefits often concentrate among numerically larger and politically organized SC groups.  Numerous commissions across India have recommended sub-categorization based on their findings, recognizing the internal disparities within the SC community.

However, they argue that true reform has been lacking in the past decade. While infrastructure projects have advanced and welfare programs have improved, governance has not effectively addressed issues such as corruption and the quality of education. 

The writer criticizes the lack of privatization in the government sector and points to the inefficiency of India's justice system and urban planning as further evidence of stagnation. They contrast Modi's promises of liberalization with the reality of continued socialist policies, lamenting the missed opportunity for deeper systemic change.

The SEBI saga involves allegations of financial impropriety within a business group. The doubters claimed the investments were illegitimate, prompting an investigation by SEBI and a subsequent inquiry by a Committee led by Justice Sapre. The Committee found issues with SEBI's investigation, noting changes in regulations and a lack of transparency concerning the ultimate beneficial owners of foreign investors.  Despite this, the Supreme Court upheld SEBI's actions and ordered the completion of its investigation. 

The matter resurfaced with allegations against SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch,  concerning potential conflicts of interest due to past investments by her and her husband in entities under SEBI scrutiny.  Buch admits to the investments but claims they were made before her appointment at SEBI and were subsequently disposed of.  The core issue revolves around whether Buch disclosed these past connections to SEBI, the government, the Justice Sapre Committee, and the Supreme Court, and whether she recused herself from the investigations.

The South Asian University, established with ambitious goals of regional integration and academic excellence, has faced a downward spiral culminating in a recent controversy. The university, meant to be free from political interference, has been increasingly controlled by the Indian government, stifling academic freedom and independence. 

This control is evident in unjustified student and faculty suspensions, unlawful expulsions, and attempts to suppress protests.  The latest incident involved a doctoral research proposal that cited a critical statement made by Noam Chomsky about Prime Minister Modi. The university's overreaction, leading to disciplinary action against a professor, highlights a culture of fear and self-censorship.

The protest, lacking overt political motives, stood in stark contrast to the state's usual political climate.

The crime reveals the enduring power imbalances that make women vulnerable, even within institutions designed to provide safety. The incident exposes the gaps between the ideal of freedom and equality promised by democracy and its lived experience for women.  Furthermore, the efforts to conceal the crime and protect the hospital's reputation underscore the complicity of institutions in protecting perpetrators and perpetuating a culture of silence.

The draft nuclear doctrine, presented in 1999, outlined India's stance as a nuclear weapons state emphasizing transparent principles of credible minimum deterrence and a retaliation-only policy. These principles, while conceived in a changed strategic environment, remain largely relevant today.  

India's stance against  first use, supported by growing but carefully calibrated nuclear capabilities, helps maintain stability  despite ongoing threats from Pakistan and China. Debates around tactical nuclear weapons and  concerns about ambiguity are addressed by the doctrine's emphasis on robust second-strike capability and  clear communication of its intentions. 
 
 The draft doctrine's core tenets continue to serve as a foundation for India's nuclear posture, providing a beacon of stability amidst evolving global nuclear dynamics.

However, the author also points out a new kind of servitude that exists today, fuelled by a relentless pressure to succeed in a competitive job market. This pressure manifests in an obsession with goals, a constant striving, and anxiety. The author argues that while progress is undeniable, issues like corruption, lack of support systems, and a disregard for ground realities undermine the true meaning of freedom.  
  
Despite these challenges, the author holds onto hope for a better future, driven by gratitude for the freedoms they have and a belief that things will eventually improve.

Indian women activists, even over a century ago, campaigned for women's empowerment. They recognized the need for financial freedom for women to exercise their agency in a patriarchal society. Early organizations like the Women's Indian Association fought for better working conditions for women, including limitations on night work and maternity benefits. The All-India Women's Conference advocated for women's rights, including the recognition of unpaid household work and financial autonomy for women. While progress has been made, particularly in inheritance laws, many of these demands remain unfulfilled. The article urges continued efforts to achieve economic equality for women through financial security, recognition of unpaid labor, and overcoming persistent social barriers.

A recent study by Anglia Ruskin University found that engaging in creative activities like arts and crafts can contribute to greater well-being than employment. While jobs can be a source of stress, hobbies offer the freedom to "fail" without consequence. The act of creating, regardless of the skill level, can bring joy and self-expression, benefiting mental health.  The study suggests that hobbies provide a valuable outlet for relaxation and stress relief, contributing to overall well-being.

### [Express View on the hottest July: Bad weather report](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-the-hottest-july-bad-weather-report-9518293/)

The world just experienced its hottest July ever recorded, marking a significant shift in global climate patterns. While the cause is partially attributed to El Nino, the unprecedented temperature rise demands immediate action.  Scientists are now focusing on climate modeling, especially microclimate forecasting, to better understand and predict local weather variations. 

Increasing the density of meteorological stations and improving information sharing between countries are crucial steps to effectively adapt to these changing conditions. Collaborative efforts, like the UNFCCC's Lima Adaptation Knowledge Initiative, can play a vital role in mitigating the impact of extreme weather events. The urgency to adapt to a changing climate is undeniable, as illustrated by recent events like the Wayanad tragedy and the Pakistan floods of 2022.

Andhra Pradesh Governor Ramlal dismissed the Telugu Desam ministry led by N T Rama Rao and appointed N Bhaskara Rao as the new Chief Minister. Rama Rao claimed to still have majority support in the Assembly. 

This action triggered strong condemnation from opposition leaders and members of Parliament, who labeled it "politically immoral" and "constitutionally invalid." The Communist Party of India blamed Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for the dismissal, calling it "murder of democracy."

### [How Britain’s anti-immigrant riots backstab UK’s flailing economy](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/britain-anti-immigrant-riots-backstab-uks-flailing-economy-9517982/)

Recent public outrage following a tragedy in the UK was exploited by far-right groups to scapegoat immigrants and non-white people.  While economic woes fueled anger, the far-right blamed immigration for Britain's economic struggles, ignoring the impact of Brexit.  

Data shows that immigrants, particularly from outside the EU, filled the labor gaps created by Brexit. They stabilized key sectors and compensated for the loss of EU workers, contributing to the UK's economic recovery. The economic downturn is attributed to factors like reduced investment, inflation, and stagnant wages, issues that the right wing failed to address. Instead, they directed anger towards immigrants, deepening societal divisions. 

Experts argue that immigration is crucial for sectors like healthcare and housing, which are already strained. Blaming immigrants diverts attention from the government's mismanagement and further harms the working class.

The Indian government withdrew a second draft of the Broadcasting Bill that would have significantly expanded government control over online content. The initial and subsequent drafts drew criticism for seeking to subject online video creators, including those producing non-news content, to regulations similar to those governing traditional broadcasters.  

Concerns were raised that the Bill could be used to suppress dissenting voices and stifle creativity, particularly given the government's track record of utilizing IT regulations to limit free expression.  

Critics argue the Bill's intent, despite being labelled as promoting "ease of doing business and living," primarily benefits government-aligned media and curtails the reach of critical content. They also point out the futility of such efforts in the current climate of globalized content production and distribution, where creators can easily transcend geographical boundaries.

### [How state governments have undermined right to education](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/state-governments-undermined-right-to-education-9517293/)

The Right to Education (RTE) Act, passed in 2010, promised universal elementary education in India.  Despite initial progress, the implementation of the Act has faced numerous challenges. A recent Bombay High Court verdict highlighted the issue of state governments attempting to circumvent the RTE's provision requiring unaided private schools to reserve seats for children from economically weaker sections.  Arguments used to justify this include concerns over resource duplication and questioning the "absolute" nature of the RTE, suggesting a lack of commitment to the law by several state governments. 

The RTE mandates mixing children from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, aiming to enhance learning and bridge social divides. This provision has been met with resistance from private schools who prefer separate sections or afternoon classes for economically weaker students. Despite efforts from some teachers to implement RTE's vision, teacher training remains a significant challenge, hindering the Act's true potential. The article concludes by expressing concern over the misuse of the RTE to exclude poor children from private schools through regulations that limit EWS admissions.

A shrinking deposit base in India's banking system is raising concerns due to its potential impact on loan growth and the overall economy. 

Banks Traditionally rely heavily on deposits, especially core deposits, for stable funding. 

However, with deposit growth slowing, banks face limitations in extending loans, particularly to businesses. This could stifle investment and economic activity.

The trend is driven by factors like competition, technological advancements, and high inflation eroding the attractiveness of bank deposits compared to other investment options. 

This situation calls for policy interventions like deepening bond markets and encouraging banks to offer more competitive alternatives to savers.

Prime Minister Modi's Independence Day speech focused on his vision for a "developed India" by 2047, emphasizing the country's potential and urging citizens, particularly the youth, to seize the opportunities.  While reiterating his government's commitment to fulfilling the aspirations of the people, Modi acknowledged the uniqueness of his third term and the need for his coalition government to listen to diverse voices.  

The speech featured significant shifts in its approach. Notably, Modi reiterated the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) as a constitutional goal, urging a nationwide debate and framing it as a  "secular" civil code. This marked a departure from the BJP's previous stance on the UCC.  Furthermore, Modi announced plans to induct 1 lakh young, politically unconnected individuals into politics to bring fresh ideas and inclusivity to governance.

### [PM’s I-Day speech: Viksit Bharat, nationalism and contradictions](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/pms-i-day-speech-viksit-bharat-nationalism-contradictions-9515885/)

This article analyzes the political implications of the Prime Minister's Independence Day speech, focusing on his vision of "Viksit Bharat" and its underlying message about national unity. The author argues that the speech frames diversity as a set of contradictions that need to be resolved for economic progress, a strategy reminiscent of colonial-era justifications for rule. 

This approach, the author contends, contradicts the spirit of anti-colonial nationalism which celebrated diversity as a source of strength.  The author further criticizes the emphasis on "reform" as a solution to national challenges, arguing that it undermines the importance of debate and dissent in shaping a just and inclusive society. Drawing from the example of a 1959 film, the author highlights a more inclusive understanding of national identity that embraces diversity rather than viewing it as a threat.  Ultimately, the article calls for a political imagination that recognizes the value of diverse perspectives in building a strong and equitable nation.

The author argues this trivialises suicide, a serious public health crisis, especially given cricket's history of mental health challenges among players. The letter highlights the tragic loss of several cricketers to suicide and the growing awareness of mental health issues within the sport. It also cites examples of how language can shape public perception of suicide and  urges broadcasters to adopt a more sensitive and responsible language policy. The author proposes mandatory training for broadcasters on this issue, drawing parallels with the recent shift towards gender-neutral language in cricket.

Thousands of groups and individuals, inspired by the promise of a better future, sent their demands and suggestions to the Constituent Assembly. They raised issues like education, employment, disability rights, and even the rights of the disabled. The public's eagerness to participate surprised the Assembly and ultimately led to the open circulation of the draft Constitution for public comment.

Through their collective struggles, Indians made themselves the protagonists of constitutionalism even before its official enactment, demonstrating that the Constitution was more than just a set of rules; it was a living embodiment of their aspirations for freedom, equality, and justice.

The coaching industry in India, despite concerns and regulations, continues to prioritize profit over student well-being. This has led to several tragedies and a system that focuses on rote learning and exam pressure rather than holistic development. 

The education system needs to shift its focus from cramming information to nurturing individual potential and fostering a love for learning. Schools should play a more central role in preparing students for competitive exams while also providing a well-rounded education that caters to diverse interests and talents.

The Supreme Court's recent caste classification verdict has sparked debate about its effectiveness in promoting equality. While the intention to expand reservation benefits is commendable, the verdict's loopholes may hinder democratic progress. 

Critics argue that prioritizing political equality over social and economic equality has marginalized scheduled castes and tribes. The success of affirmative action hinges on addressing economic inequality and dismantling the power structures of Brahmanical hegemony.  

Furthermore, the 50% reservation cap and the absence of quotas in the private sector remain major obstacles. The judiciary's inconsistent stance on affirmative action, evident in contrasting rulings across states, further complicates the issue.  

Addressing caste-based discrimination requires a multi-pronged approach, including a caste census, scientific data-driven policymaking, and a commitment to "annihilation of caste" by ensuring equal opportunities for all marginalized groups.

Bangladesh experienced an uprising fueled by widespread youth frustration due to  jobless growth. Despite a positive GDP growth rate, employment growth remained stagnant, leading to economic disparity and social unrest. This situation, exacerbated by political autocracy, triggered violent protests that ultimately forced the Prime Minister to flee the country.  

Jobless growth has become a significant security concern for many low- and middle-income nations, as it contributes to social instability and political violence.

The Supreme Court's recent ruling allowing states to sub-classify SCs and STs for reservations has sparked both political avoidance and criticism from advocates of the reservation policy.  This ruling reflects the complexities and uncertainties surrounding the post-Mandal era.

Mandal, a concept encompassing caste politics, evolved in two phases. The pre-Mandal period witnessed struggles against caste, influenced by figures like Jyotiba Phule and Periyar, culminating in the recognition of backward castes in electoral politics from 1967 onwards. 

The post-Mandal phase, marked by the judicial debate and implementation of reservations, saw a shift toward viewing numerical representation as the sole solution to social injustice. This approach, while reinforcing the reservation regime, arguably overshadowed the broader goals of dismantling caste-based hierarchies.

The ruling raises critical questions about the effectiveness and future trajectory of reservation policy. 

 It necessitates a reassessment of the social blocs on which reservations are based, considering their evolving nature and internal divisions. The challenges of addressing new power asymmetries beyond the confines of caste, class, and power require fresh approaches and political discourse.

The methodology has limitations, including potential overestimation of labor force due to high projected population growth, especially in rural areas, and the inclusion of subsidiary employment, often involving unpaid family workers. 

Concerns arise about the temporal comparability of WPR data shifting from the Employment-Unemployment Surveys (EUS) to the Periodic Labour Force Surveys (PLFS), and the use of projected population figures from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, which may be inflated.  Comparisons with data from the Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE) further cast doubt on the accuracy of employment figures. Given these methodological issues, claims of significant job creation based solely on KLEMS data warrant critical examination.

### [Express View on Muhammad Yunus government: Keep the social peace](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-muhammad-yunus-government-keep-the-social-peace-9512651/)

Following the ouster of Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh now faces a period of uncertainty. Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Laureate economist, has been tasked with leading the interim government. His primary challenge lies in uniting the deeply divided country and restoring peace.

The recent protests, while ostensibly against Hasina's regime, have taken on a dangerous communal turn with increased attacks on the Hindu minority.  

Addressing this violence and ensuring the safety of minorities is a top priority for Yunus. The task is further complicated by the absence of the Awami League, Hasina's party, from the interim government. Yunus must now find ways to engage all stakeholders, including the Awami League, to heal the nation's wounds.  Bangladesh needs stability and unity, and the onus is on Yunus to guide the country through this turbulent period.

### [Kolkata doctor’s rape and murder shows how we fail women — yet again](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/kolkata-doctors-rape-and-murder-shows-how-we-fail-women-yet-again-9512652/)

Two recent incidents highlight the persistent issue of women's safety in India. The death of a trainee doctor in Kolkata after a sexual assault and the lifelong vegetative state of Aruna Shanbaug, assaulted decades ago, underscore the failure to adequately protect women, despite pronouncements of female empowerment. 

The death in Kolkata exposes  inadequate security measures within medical institutions, including a lack of on-call rooms and malfunctioning CCTV cameras. The widespread underutilization of the Nirbhaya Fund, established after the 2012 Delhi gangrape, further illustrates the disconnect between promises and action. While demanding justice is crucial, the focus should be on addressing the systemic issues that perpetuate violence against women, ensuring safe workplaces, and fulfilling commitments to equality.

### [C Raja Mohan writes: Bangladesh and the ‘foreign hand’ bogey](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bangladesh-student-protests-the-foreign-hand-bogey-9512007/)

The article critiques the theory that a US-backed coup orchestrated by Muhammad Yunus ousted Sheikh Hasina from power in Bangladesh. It argues that this conspiracy theory ignores the real reasons behind Hasina's downfall, namely her own political missteps and growing unpopularity. 

The author points out that Hasina’s authoritarian tendencies, rigged elections, and economic mismanagement created anti-regime sentiment, which  culminated in the student movement’s protests.  

The article further argues that attributing Hasina's loss solely to external forces reflects a failure of Indian strategic thinking and overlooks the complexities of Bangladeshi politics. It suggests that India should instead focus on cooperating with the new Bangladeshi government while supporting the democratic aspirations of the student movement.  


The author acknowledges Hasina's significant contributions to Bangladesh's development and her strong relationship with India. Finally, they emphasize the need for continued collaboration between India and the US in the region, especially given the current political instability in Bangladesh and Myanmar.

This article explores the use of Guru Dutt's film "Pyaasa" as a parallel to Plato's "Allegory of the Cave" in a Creative Writing classroom. The author compares Dutt's portrayal of a neglected poet, Vijay, with the prisoners in the cave who mistake shadows for reality.  Vijay's rejection by society mirrors the prisoners' inability to perceive true reality beyond the confines of their cave. The article argues that both Plato and Dutt challenge conventional thinking, prompting audiences to question the nature of truth and the influence of power structures. By showcasing Vijay's poignant song, "yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye toh kya hai," the author emphasizes the importance of art and introspection over material wealth and societal validation. Ultimately, the article advocates for a more philosophical approach to creative writing that encourages deep contemplation and questioning of societal norms.

The recent instability in Bangladesh is a result of deep-seated fault lines within the country.  

These include a conflict between secularism, Islamic identity, and Bengali popular culture. Historical divisions stemming from the 1971 War of Liberation, particularly regarding India's role, further exacerbate tensions. Public perception of India is often negative, influenced by propaganda and a belief that India's support came at a cost. 

Bangladesh also struggles with unstable civil-military relations. The military's involvement in commercial activities and its politicization create a sense of unease. These internal divisions contribute to the current turmoil, including attacks on minorities and the government's inability to effectively manage the situation.

The Indian government recently waived clinical trials for certain drug categories approved in developed nations, aiming to expedite access to innovative therapies like those for Alzheimer's, cancer, and autoimmune disorders. This move could benefit both patients and pharmaceutical companies by reducing costs and timelines. 

However, ensuring affordability remains crucial.  The government should consider expanding healthcare safety nets and exploring state procurement of novel drugs to minimize the financial burden on patients.  Promoting domestic research through incentives and ease of business is also essential, as India aims to move beyond its generic drug stronghold and contribute to developing new drug molecules.

Bangladesh's remarkable socio-economic development and successes in sectors like microfinance have been commended by India. Moving forward, both nations need to address outstanding issues through cooperation and diplomacy, focusing on shared challenges like poverty, unemployment, and climate change. The hope is for a future marked by mutual trust and progress, building on the foundations laid in recent years.

The Supreme Court ruled that the right to a speedy trial is a fundamental right protected by Article 21 of the Constitution. This decision, while not introducing new legal principles, carries significant weight as the Court acted upon its stated position and clarified its application within the context of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).  

The judgement, which  freed Manish Sisodia after 17 months in jail, highlights the Court's criticism of both the state and the judiciary for delays in trials. The Court emphasized that bail is the rule and imprisonment the exception, urging lower courts to adhere to this principle and considering the length of incarceration without trial.

With  favorable weather conditions, the upcoming rabi cropping season also appears promising. The surplus monsoon and absence of heat waves are expected to ease food inflation, which has been a concern for the past few months. This could allow the government to ease restrictions on exports and stock limits for cereals, sugar, and pulses.

The Waqf Amendment Bill, 2024 has sparked anxiety within a section of the Muslim community. However, it's important to analyze the proposal objectively as this is not the first time the waqf law is being amended.  Previous amendments in 1913, 1930, 1995, and 2013, along with recommendations from the Sachar Committee and a Joint Parliamentary Committee, highlight that reforms to waqf administration have been a long-standing concern. 

The government has received numerous grievances from Muslims regarding waqf property encroachments, mismanagement, and delays in registration.  Furthermore, the vast potential of waqf properties for socio-economic development, considering their status as public institutions and the largest landholders after Railways and Defence, necessitates improvements in their administration. International examples such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and others demonstrate the successful regulation and public engagement with waqf properties by governments. 


Therefore, the debate on waqf reforms should be based on facts, experience, and a commitment to social justice and gender equity.

### [Antitrust deja vu: Ruling against Google is reminiscent of a similar one against Microsoft in 2001](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/google-antitrust-ruling-microsoft-9509449/)

The author reflects on Microsoft's historical monopolistic practices, referencing a 2001 ruling against the company for leveraging its dominance in the OS market to stifle browser competition.  Drawing parallels to the recent antitrust ruling against Google, the author argues that despite legal challenges, technology giants like Microsoft and Google have deeply ingrained themselves in our digital lives, making it difficult to dislodge them. 

The author contends that in emerging markets, access to technology is often facilitated through piracy, a factor not adequately addressed by anti-competition law.  Ultimately, the author suggests that the future threat to Google's dominance may not come from competing search engines but from the emergence of generative AI.

K Natwar Singh, a prominent figure in India's Foreign Service, transitioned seamlessly into politics, becoming the External Affairs Minister. Known for his strong connections with influential figures, including the Nehru-Gandhis and literary personalities, he navigated international relations with finesse.  Serving as India's representative at the UN Decolonisation Committee fostered enduring bonds with African freedom fighters.

Vinesh Phogat's journey to the Paris Olympics mirrored Rocky's determination, with her striving to "go the distance" both in the ring and against systemic injustices. Her fight for justice extended beyond her personal experience, resonating with countless women who saw their own struggles in her battle against the Wrestling Federation of India president, who was accused of sexual assault. 

While her historic win against the defending champion was a significant victory, her subsequent disqualification sparked outrage and highlighted the cultural challenges women face in India. Her story transcends a simple quest for a medal, representing a broader struggle for dignity and recognition.  While a medal can serve as consolation, the real challenge lies in dismantling the systems that perpetuate injustice and empower women to pursue their dreams without facing undue burdens.

Recent political shifts in Afghanistan and neighboring South Asian countries like Bangladesh and Maldives have dealt a blow to India's foreign policy interests. These unexpected changes raise questions about whether India's foreign policy and security establishments were adequately prepared or caught unaware. 

India's National Security structure has evolved significantly since 1998, with the establishment of bodies like the National Security Council and National Security Advisor (NSA). These institutions aim to coordinate strategic and security functions. However, concerns have been raised about potential "turf" issues between different agencies and the influence of these issues on decision-making. There's a need to scrutinize whether the failures stem from structural inadequacies, misjudgments, or both.

This Independence Day, India faces a crucial moment for its democracy.  The recent electoral result, which significantly reduced the ruling party's majority, has underscored the importance of safeguarding democratic values.  

The government, accustomed to unchallenged authority, is now encountering a more assertive opposition, demanding greater accountability and freedom from perceived arrogance.  This new dynamic is forcing the government to adapt and engage in a less centralized and more transparent manner, as evidenced by the referral of a controversial bill to a parliamentary committee.  

However, challenges remain. Instances of partisan behavior from the ruling side, a hardening stance on religious autonomy, and the use of legal provisions to target political opponents raise concerns about backsliding on democratic norms.  Simultaneously, the judiciary's recent bail decision for a senior opposition leader offers a glimmer of hope for an independent institution acting as a check on governmental power. 
 
India continues to strive for a balance between its democratic traditions and the evolving political landscape.

In the UK, a stabbing incident at a dance studio, initially linked to a Muslim immigrant, fueled Islamophobia and prompted concerns about the rise of far-right sentiments.   

Protests in Bangladesh over job quotas led to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fleeing to India, raising questions about the stability of the Bangladeshi government and its implications for regional dynamics.

### [From the ground at Paris Olympics, a question: What will it take for India to become a sporting nation?](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/paris-olympics-india-hockey-sport-consistency-9506283/)

The article discusses India's rise in international hockey, analyzing the factors contributing to the team's success. While acknowledging the improvement in sporting infrastructure and talent development, the author emphasizes the importance of a deeper understanding and appreciation of sports among the general public. 

Drawing from her experience watching the Olympics, the author highlights the German fans' informed and analytical approach to the game. She contrasts this with the tendency in India to either idolize or criticize athletes without a nuanced understanding of the sport itself. 

Ultimately, the author argues that for India to become a true sporting nation, citizens need to engage with sports beyond simply cheering for their teams. Experiencing and understanding the nuances of various sports will foster a deeper respect for athletes and contribute to a more informed and supportive sporting culture.

### [Prabhat Patnaik writes on Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee: A communist first](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/prabhat-patnaik-writes-on-buddhadeb-bhattacharjee-a-communist-first-9506157/)

Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee's involvement in communist politics stemmed from the vibrant intellectual and cultural environment of Bengal, combined with the party's strong organizational structure and commitment to land reforms. As part of the Left Front government, he played a crucial role in implementing policies that addressed economic disparity, strengthened participatory democracy, and boosted agricultural growth. However, his later decision to attract private industrial investment,  a departure from the party's traditional stance, led to alienation of the peasantry and ultimately contributed to the Left Front's decline. Despite this, Buddhadev Bhattacharjee's legacy remains significant for his championing of land rights, fostering grassroots politics, and promoting dialogue with internal resident groups through autonomous councils.

### [SC/ST Sub-quota red lines and red herrings](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sc-st-sub-quota-red-lines-and-red-herrings-9505474/)

The recent Supreme Court verdict on sub-quotas within the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) reservations has sparked debate. 

Supporters of social justice argue that the verdict, while seemingly concerning diluting reservation,  actually strengthens affirmative action by focusing on the needs of the most disadvantaged communities within these categories. Some criticisms against the ruling, focused on legal and political grounds, are deemed inaccurate and lacking evidence. 

The article highlights specific concerns regarding the potential misuse of sub-classification for political gains and the unintended consequences of applying the "creamy layer" doctrine to SCs and STs.  

It suggests focusing on addressing these flaws in the judgment rather than rejecting the notion of sub-quotas altogether.  Long-term solutions, such as enhancing reservation percentages, removing the 50% ceiling, and broadening the scope of social justice initiatives beyond public sector jobs, are also emphasized. Ultimately, the article urges a nuanced discussion that addresses the complexities of the verdict and its implications.

### [Ram Madhav writes: In Bangladesh, it’s time for healing](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ram-madhav-writes-in-bangladesh-its-time-for-healing-9505462/)

Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's long-serving prime minister, recently faced unprecedented protests from young citizens  due to economic hardships and unrest triggered by the reinstatement of a controversial quota system for government jobs. Despite Bangladesh's significant economic growth under Hasina,  inequality widened, unemployment rose, and cost of living soared, leading to resentment among the youth. Protests, initially against the quota system, escalated into a larger movement against Hasina's government.  The government's heavy-handed response,  labels the protests as "terrorism," and deployment of the ruling party's student wing against agitating students further inflamed the situation.

The Supreme Court granted bail to Manish Sisodia, former Delhi deputy Chief Minister, after he spent over a year and a half in jail without conviction. The court emphasized that bail is the norm and jail an exception, highlighting the importance of speedy trials to uphold the right to life and liberty.  

The judgment also states that the right to bail should be considered in cases of significant delay coupled with prolonged incarceration. The court expects trial courts and High Courts to adhere to the "bail is the rule, jail is the exception" principle while considering bail applications under both the CrPC and PMLA. This comes as the right to bail faces pressure, particularly in money laundering cases. 


The court acknowledged the state's assurance that the trial would be concluded within 6-8 months, but also recognized the impracticality of such a timeline given the volume of witnesses and documents.  The judgment underscores the importance of sharing all relevant evidence, including potentially exculpatory material, to ensure a fair trial.

### [SC verdict on subclassification of caste-based reservation will worsen reality of the Dalit community. Here’s why](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sc-verdict-on-subclassification-of-caste-based-reservation-will-worsen-reality-of-the-dalit-community-heres-why-9505463/)

The Supreme Court's verdict allowing sub-classification within Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes and introducing a creamy layer concept is highly problematic.  The judgment ignores the severe social realities faced by a vast majority of Dalits who struggle for basic survival and are unable to benefit from reservation. The court overlooks the fact that government posts reserved for SCs/STs remain vacant due to a lack of eligible candidates, often cited as a consequence of  systemic disadvantages.  

Equating the OBC creamy layer with Dalit exclusion from reservation is illogical given the distinct social and economic positions of the two groups. Sub-classifying Dalits will only exacerbate existing inequalities and create further division.   

The judgment disregards the persistent social stigma and "camouflaged untouchability" faced by Dalits, regardless of their economic status, which remains a primary justification for reservation. The court's decision also violates constitutional provisions that clearly define the process for identifying Scheduled Castes and prohibits any subsequent modifications.

The author believes that India's continued support for the new leadership in Bangladesh is crucial to prevent further instability. While highlighting the importance of protecting minority rights, particularly the Hindu community, the author urges India to avoid focusing solely on this issue, which could complicate relations. 

The author suggests that India should understand the student-led revolution in Bangladesh, engage with its leaders, and review its own policies that failed to anticipate the political turmoil.  They emphasize that Bangladesh is not "India's to lose" but "India's to win" through constructive engagement, emphasizing the need for India to shed any illusions of regional hegemony and build genuine support through diplomacy and economic cooperation.  Despite the current crisis, the author expresses optimism about the resilience of India-Bangladesh relations, with strategic patience and empathy playing key roles in navigating the situation.

Vinesh Phogat's disqualification from the gold-medal wrestling bout at the Paris Olympics has sparked widespread outrage in India. The incident is viewed as more than just a lost medal, as Phogat represents the struggle of Indian sportswomen against sexual abuse within the Wrestling Federation of India.  

Phogat and other wrestlers bravely exposed allegations against the then-WFI president, Brij Bhushan Singh, leading to a prolonged battle for justice. Despite facing backlash and hostility, Phogat persevered and achieved remarkable success in the Olympics. 

Her disqualification, however, has raised serious questions about the fairness of the system and the government's handling of the situation. The public is demanding answers and accountability, highlighting a larger issue of systemic injustice faced by athletes, especially women.

### [How uncertainty of food inflation affects RBI’s policy going forward](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/food-inflation-rbi-policy-9503587/)

The RBI Monetary Policy Committee has kept policy rates unchanged, acknowledging market expectations but noting uncertainty about future actions. Food inflation, a significant component of the CPI basket, remains elevated due to climatic factors. While core inflation is subdued, high food prices impact household expectations, complicating the RBI's policy stance.

The RBI aims for a 4% CPI inflation target, but food inflation volatility poses a challenge. A strong monsoon may moderate food prices, but achieving the target remains a challenge. The RBI projects average FY25 inflation at 4.5%, with growth anticipated at 7.2%.

Global economic conditions are uncertain, with geo-political tensions and monetary policy divergence among countries.  The RBI is monitoring bank deposit growth and credit risk, noting the diversion of household savings towards other asset classes.  The RBI is likely to assess food inflation trends and could consider a shallow rate cut later in the year if food inflation moderates.

The Blair Witch Project, released in 1999, ingeniously blurred the lines between fact and fiction, capitalizing on the early internet's naivety. The film's "found footage" style, supported by a persuasive online campaign featuring fabricated evidence, created an unsettling ambiguity for viewers. 

Nowadays, the internet's evolution, marked by the prevalence of "found footage" tropes and the proliferation of deepfakes, has made such deception less effective.

The RBI maintained its interest rates and focus on withdrawing accommodation in its August meeting. While headline inflation rose to 5.08% in June due to food price surges, the RBI anticipates moderation in the second quarter, projecting full year inflation at 4.5%. 

Growth prospects remain strong, enabling the MPC to prioritize inflation control. High food inflation, particularly in cereals, pulses, and vegetables, poses a risk of fueling household inflation expectations and potentially spilling over to core inflation.  

Despite this, core inflation remains subdued, encouraging the RBI's continued disinflationary stance. Global trends suggest that central banks are considering interest rate cuts, but the RBI awaits further clarity on food inflation's trajectory before making policy adjustments at its October meeting.

Weight management in sports, particularly wrestling, involves careful strategies to fit within weight categories. Athletes often employ extreme measures to shed weight before competitions, such as excessive workouts, fasting, and dehydration.  This practice, while effective for short-term weight loss, can be detrimental to an athlete's health, leading to muscle loss, injury, and psychological issues.  The weight-loss methods commonly employed can lead athletes into a catabolic state, where their bodies begin breaking down muscle for energy. Despite the risks,  athletes continue to engage in these practices to gain a competitive advantage. The case of Vinesh Phogat, who narrowly missed her weight limit, highlights the potential for complications and the delicate balance between training and health.

The Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), launched in 2018, aimed to improve healthcare coverage for India's poorest population. An analysis of recent household expenditure survey data shows that while coverage of public health insurance programs increased for the poorest population quintiles since 2018, it remains low, with less than 30% covered.  Furthermore, the utilization of public health insurance among covered individuals remains low. The data also reveals that while the burden of out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) for inpatient care has decreased for the poorest populations, they still incur significant costs.  



Despite some progress, the survey indicates that India is still lagging in achieving Universal Health Coverage through targeted public health insurance. Key challenges remain in expanding coverage to the intended beneficiaries and ensuring robust financial protection, particularly for the poorest populations.

### [Reducing the poor’s health burden](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ayushman-bharat-india-poor-9501487/)

This analysis examines the vulnerability of India's bottom 50% population to medical shocks, particularly hospitalisation, using data from the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) 2022-23. 

It reveals a positive trend: the proportion of households experiencing hospitalisation has increased, indicating improved healthcare access.  Interestingly, while overall health expenditure has risen slightly for households without hospitalisation, the share consumed by hospitalisation has declined significantly. This suggests hospitalisation is becoming more affordable. 

Furthermore, the analysis shows a decrease in the likelihood of households facing a decline in consumption status due to hospitalisation costs. This improvement is particularly pronounced in rural areas and for households with young children and elderly members.  The study attributes these positive developments to public health policies like Ayushman Bharat Yojana, aimed at mitigating the financial burden of hospitalisation for the poor.

India is grappling with an issue of witch-hunting, despite strides in development. While global awareness of the problem is increasing, India faces a unique challenge. Though most incidents occur in rural areas, witch-hunting remains a serious concern, documented by the NCRB.  

Between 2009 and 2019, the UN recorded 20,000 cases of harmful witch-related practices across 60 countries, including India. Despite various state-specific laws aiming to combat this practice, implementation remains a challenge. 

Low prosecution rates, lenient penalties, and a lack of clarity regarding the intent of the legislation hinder effective action. The issue requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing education, awareness campaigns, and reforms within the criminal justice system.  It also demands a clear distinction between the practice of witchcraft and the accusation of witchcraft, which often leads to violence and persecution.

One significant proposal was to simplify capital gains taxation by introducing a flat tax rate of 12.5% across all asset classes, while eliminating the indexation benefit for property, gold, and unlisted assets.  This sparked criticism, leading the government to amend the proposal. Investors now have the option to choose between the lower tax rate of 12.5% without indexation or the existing 20% tax rate with indexation for properties acquired before July 23, 2024.  The government's aim is to provide clarity and reduce tax uncertainties for individuals.

The concept of Waqf stems from Islamic religious beliefs, involving the dedication of property for charitable purposes.  It is a form of religious charity, not an obligation, and its history is deeply rooted in legal frameworks. The proposed amendments to the Waqf Act, however, raise concerns. They grant extensive government control over Waqf properties, which are considered private and self-acquired by Muslims.  Critics argue that this  oversteps constitutional guarantees, particularly regarding the management of religious properties and the rights of Muslim citizens. 


The amendments also introduce impediments to the creation of new Waqfs and threaten existing ones through the concept of adverse possession. These measures are seen as undermining the autonomy of Waqf institutions and creating vulnerabilities for the Muslim community.

Bangladesh is experiencing political turmoil following student-led protests that escalated into demands for the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The protests, initially focused on job-quota concerns, reflected a deeper discontent stemming from Bangladesh’s history of cyclical political violence and party rivalry.  The situation led to Hasina’s resignation and the establishment of an interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.

### [Lesson from coaching centre tragedy: Don’t break the dreams of students](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/lesson-coaching-centre-tragedy-break-dreams-students-9500329/)

The coaching industry in India has grown into a dominant force, pressuring students to achieve success through standardized tests and narrow career paths. This has led to a focus on rote learning and competition, neglecting the joy of learning and the development of well-rounded individuals. 

The author argues that this system is detrimental, leading to mental exhaustion, anxiety, and a decline in creativity and critical thinking. They propose three steps to address this issue:  redefine the purpose of education to prioritize life skills and compassion, encourage critical thinking and activism against the decline of public education, and restore the meaning of studentship as a lifelong journey of learning and exploration.

This article discusses a controversial port project in Great Nicobar Island. The project site, Galathea Bay, was previously designated as a wildlife sanctuary due to its significant ecological value, including nesting grounds for endangered sea turtles and coral reefs. 

Despite this, the sanctuary was de-notified, and the project received environmental clearance, raising concerns about environmental damage. The article highlights inconsistencies and questionable decisions made by government agencies, ultimately concluding that the project proceeds despite the area's clear designation as a protected zone.

While India's constitutional changes regarding Kashmir have diminished its international salience, the issue remains significant in the bilateral relationship with Pakistan. 

The international focus on Kashmir has lessened due to India's economic growth, stronger partnerships with the West and the Islamic world, and Pakistan's internal political divisions. However,  Pakistan continues to back cross-border terrorism and opposes the constitutional changes, hindering formal engagement between the two nations. Although civilian leaders in Pakistan have shown interest in dialogue, the military's influence remains strong.  India must remain vigilant, addressing internal reconciliation in Kashmir, counterterrorism efforts, and engaging with diverse segments of Pakistani society to ensure lasting peace.

The article discusses the history of sex testing in sport, focusing on the case of Spanish athlete Maria Jose Martinez-Patino who was subjected to traumatic testing due to androgen insensitivity.  Sex testing evolved from "nude parades" to chromosome testing before ending in 1999. The debate shifted to testosterone levels, leading to the case of Indian sprinter Dutee Chand, who successfully challenged regulations based on high testosterone. The article argues that the binary insistence on male and female categories in sport is flawed, given the spectrum of biological sex variations. It highlights the case of Martinez-Patino, who later participated in arguments against Chand despite her own experience with problematic testing, demonstrating the complex and often contradictory nature of this issue.

India's transition to green energy is characterized by diverse state-led initiatives, reflecting a lack of uniform progress. While the central government has made notable strides in setting targets and promoting collaboration between ministries, challenges persist in areas like transmission infrastructure, energy storage, and securing long-term green finance.  

State governments exhibit varying levels of commitment and progress, influenced by factors like policy environment, demographics, and financial resources.  

The green energy transition presents a complex policy dilemma, balancing national security concerns regarding dependence on China with the imperative of accelerating the shift to clean energy.  

Furthermore, the article highlights the ethical imperative of addressing global warming, urging a shift from nationalistic realpolitik towards a cooperative, global governance framework that prioritizes human well-being and environmental sustainability.

Isaac Asimov's Foundation series depicts a futuristic society facing inevitable collapse, with a scientist establishing a repository of knowledge to preserve humanity.  Similarly, modern scientists propose a "lunar biorepository" to safeguard endangered species' DNA against potential extinction from various threats.  While this reflects a sci-fi fantasy becoming reality, it risks overshadowing the crucial point that for many, Earth remains their only home.

The 2024 IOC guidelines promote inclusivity in sports, emphasizing the right of all individuals to participate regardless of gender identity. However, Algerian boxer Imane Khelif and Taiwanese athlete Lin Yu-ting have faced discrimination at the Paris Olympics, highlighting the persisting challenges related to gender identity in sports.  Historical gender tests have often been influenced by cultural biases rather than scientific objectivity.  Critics of including transgender athletes argue that it undermines the achievements of cisgender women, while athletes like Khelif and Dutee Chand have battled for recognition and acceptance in the face of such prejudice.  It is crucial to balance the need for fair competition with respect for the dignity and rights of all athletes.

### [From Bangladesh’s students, a message: A fighting chance](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bangladesh-protests-students-message-fighting-chance-9498611/)

Bangladesh is experiencing a significant political shift following the end of Sheikh Hasina's rule. This moment presents both opportunities and risks, requiring India to approach the situation with caution and respect for Bangladeshi agency.

While India has legitimate interests in Bangladesh's stability and security, its past support for authoritarianism should be re-evaluated. Simplifying the complex political dynamics by framing events solely through an Islamist lens risks alienating the Bangladeshi people.

Bangladesh faces two main challenges: reconciling its religious and secular identities, and establishing a truly democratic party system. Student movements, with their history of challenging authoritarianism, hold a crucial role in shaping the country's future. India should avoid interfering in Bangladesh's internal processes and instead encourage the country's path towards greater freedom and institutionalization.

Recent riots across several British towns, sparked by rumors and misinformation surrounding the stabbing of three girls in Southport, have highlighted the growing influence of far-right ideologies and online hate speech. The violence, which targeted mosques, asylum seeker housing, and other symbols of diversity, has raised serious concerns about the state of civil society and the government's ability to address the root causes of this unrest. While public figures and communities have condemned the violence and expressed solidarity with the victims, the incident has exposed deep-seated anxieties about immigration and the potential for online falsehoods to incite real-world harm. The Labour government faces the urgent challenge of tackling far-right extremism, ensuring swift justice for those responsible, and engaging in honest and constructive dialogue about immigration to counter the divisive rhetoric that fueled these events.

The draft Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2024 seeks to extend regulations from traditional television to the internet, potentially impacting online speech and creative independence.  

The bill defines "digital news broadcasters" broadly, encompassing platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and podcasts discussing current affairs. It mandates registration, adherence to a Programme Code, and pre-certification for non-news content. 

Concerns arise from the bill's potential for censorship, particularly concerning political commentators. The broad powers granted to the government, coupled with extra-territorial application, raise questions about its practicality and potential impact on global content creators.  The bill also imposes new obligations on social media intermediaries, adding to existing regulatory burdens on free speech.  Critics argue that the bill's approach is ill-suited to the decentralized nature of the internet and propose alternative mechanisms like the IT Act 2000 for addressing concerns about harmful content.  The authors advocate for thorough deliberation and stakeholder engagement before the bill is enacted, emphasizing its significant implications for the future of online expression in India.

The political landscape in Bangladesh has shifted dramatically with the resignation of Sheikh Hasina and the rise of army control. Protests triggered by economic hardship and government corruption have led to this change. 

India should acknowledge the Bangladeshi people's right to self-determination and support their expression of will. While acknowledging the positive developments in India-Bangladesh relations under Hasina's rule, it's important to allow the situation to stabilize and avoid taking sides. India should prioritize economic engagement with a future government while also maintaining a cautious and discreet approach. 

Pakistan and China might try to exploit the situation to challenge India's influence, but Delhi should focus on strengthening its ties with the Bangladeshi people based on shared interests and cultural affinities.

Sheikh Hasina's recent resignation and fleeing from Bangladesh follows a period of growing unrest and challenges to her authority. Despite her party's electoral victory, the election was marred by allegations of rigging and a boycott by opposition parties. Protests against job quotas escalated into nationwide demonstrations, met with a harsh response from the government that resulted in significant casualties. The recent turmoil highlights the limitations of Hasina's development narrative and her increasingly authoritarian methods.  Her unyielding stance on historical narratives and the suppression of dissent alienated segments of the populace, potentially paving the way for the resurgence of Islamist and pro-Pakistan sentiments. Hasina's downfall presents a challenge for India, which must now navigate the complexities of maintaining its relationship with Bangladesh while safeguarding its interests in the face of rising internal instability.

Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's longtime Prime Minister, resigned after 15 years in power.  Her rule, characterized by notable economic progress, was marred by alleged authoritarianism, suppression of dissent, and widespread corruption. Protests, initially sparked by student demands for quota reforms, escalated into a broader movement against her government's policies. 

The public's anger was fueled by the government's response to the protests, which included the deployment of force and the labelling of demonstrators as traitors. Hasina's departure signifies a turning point in Bangladesh's political landscape, highlighting the delicate balance between economic development and democratic values.

Recent events in Jammu have demonstrated a resurgence of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, with militants exploiting voids created by a shift in focus to other conflicts. 

This situation echoes past patterns of infiltration and tactical strategies employed by terrorists over the years. To address this,  a unified command, leveraging intelligence and engaging the local population, is crucial.  Synergy between the Army and CAPFs is essential, alongside re-equipping and training Village Defence Guards. 

The experience of previous counter-terrorism operations, including the successful strategy of  clearing jungle areas and denying terrorists refuge,  should be revisited.  Ultimately, sustained operations and effective logistics management are key to outmaneuvering and neutralizing the threat.

The UK is experiencing riots following a knife attack in Southport that killed three children. The unrest, concentrated in England,  is fueled by discontent towards immigrants, perceived to be competing for resources like housing and jobs. Economic stagnation since 2008 has exacerbated these feelings. Previous riots in the 1970s, spurred by socio-economic disparities and racial tensions, resulted in police reforms. The UK's exit from Europe, driven by anxieties over immigration, further heightened these concerns. Islamophobia, amplified by the tragic incident's false associations to Muslims, fueled the recent unrest. While authorities promise swift action against rioters, the underlying economic issues require urgent addressing to prevent further social unrest.

The Indian stock market significantly declined, triggered by growing concerns about the US economy. While domestic flows have driven the market lately,  high valuations  in India, defying logic,  raise concerns about a deeper correction.  

Though bulls have attempted to justify the continuous upward movement, the current cycle seems driven by fear of missing out and greed rather than fundamentals.  A price-to-earnings ratio similar to levels seen before the 2007 bull market peak  is a warning sign. Even companies with mediocre growth and challenging operating environments are experiencing soaring valuations. Market segments like small and midcaps and public sector companies exhibit extreme exuberance.  


Some CEO comments highlight this disconnect, with companies stating concerns about GDP correlation and challenging demand conditions while their stocks trade at inflated PE ratios. The question is whether the market will eventually adopt a more realistic view of valuations and growth prospects or if the bull run will continue.

Five years after the abrogation of Article 370, Jammu and Kashmir has seen improvements in economic development, governance, and tourism.  While security remains a concern with increasing infiltration in the Jammu sector and Pakistan's continued involvement in sponsoring terrorism, the region has experienced a record voter turnout in the recent elections.

The Jammu and Kashmir Budget 2024-25 reveals a concerning economic picture five years after the abrogation of Article 370. Despite increased borrowing, public investment has declined sharply. Tax incidence and efficiency have also decreased, while the unemployment rate remains high. The abrogation, while ending the previous political discourse on Kashmir, has failed to deliver on promises of peace and prosperity.  Social media celebration of its revocation masks the underlying anxiety and disillusionment in Kashmir. Valley-centric political parties find themselves struggling to articulate a meaningful alternative, as the reality of a redefined role for the government sets in.


While restoring statehood enjoys national support, it is insufficient to address the complex socio-economic challenges facing Kashmir. The political leadership needs to engage in a transformative process, re-evaluating their ideology and re-positioning themselves to represent the plural, progressive aspirations of the people. This is the time for Kashmir to play a crucial role in shaping a more inclusive national narrative.

The Supreme Court recently permitted the sub-classification of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for reservation purposes. This decision allows states to differentiate within these categories to fine-tune affirmative action policies. The court emphasized the importance of empirical evidence and a clear rationale for sub-classification, subject to judicial review. 

While the ruling aims to address disparities within SC/ST communities, concerns have been raised about potential constitutional violations, political manipulation, and increased competition among marginalized groups. To ensure fair implementation, a comprehensive caste census is crucial. 



The verdict highlights the complex interplay of social justice, politics, and legal interpretations in India.

Both exemplify the immigrant experience, leveraging their traditional Indian values and educational achievements to attain success. The author contrasts their rise in a society that encourages individuality and opportunity with the perceived limitations and societal pressures faced by similarly qualified Indians in their home country.  

The article argues that cultural norms and systemic issues in India stifle innovation and ambition, leading to a culture of mediocrity. It laments that while women like Harris and Vance thrive in a welcoming environment that values diversity, Indian society often discourages risk-taking and personal fulfillment.  Ultimately, the author suggests that India needs to foster a more inclusive and empowering environment to encourage its citizens to reach their full potential.

The author shares a personal experience of caste-based discrimination despite financial security, highlighting the persistence of social inequalities. While acknowledging the need to revisit reservations in light of changing social dynamics, the author questions how to objectively define who is most marginalised and fears that the reform could be exploited for political gain. The author emphasizes that economic progress alone does not eradicate the social disadvantages faced by Dalits, and a comprehensive caste survey is necessary to effectively address this issue.  Ultimately, the author argues that reservation, envisioned as a tool for achieving social equity and dismantling caste-based discrimination, must be preserved to ensure the continued upliftment of marginalized communities.

ICAE, with roots tracing back to Rabindranath Tagore and Lord L K Elmhirst's vision in 1921, focuses on global food and nutritional security.  

A unique study presented at ICAE compares the agricultural practices and outcomes of 20 Indian states with 15 African countries, highlighting key areas for improvement.  Both regions face challenges such as underfunding of agricultural research and development, and low agricultural spending relative to social protection. 

The study recommends prioritizing investments in agricultural R&D and extension, reforming subsidies, and allocating resources to infrastructure development to boost agricultural growth and enhance child nutrition. 

The conference emphasizes the need for South-South collaboration, particularly between India and Africa, to address pressing food and nutritional security challenges, learning from each other's experiences and working together to build resilient food systems.
