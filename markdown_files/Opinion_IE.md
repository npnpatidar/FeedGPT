### [Why RBI’s attempts to control the Rupee can have adverse consequences](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-rbis-attempts-to-control-the-rupee-can-have-adverse-consequences-9529975/)

The article argues that the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) recent regulatory measures aimed at managing the Indian rupee's volatility are misguided. It contends that currency fluctuations are a natural market response and that using regulations for currency control introduces uncertainty and increases business costs.  Three examples are given: prohibiting speculative trading in rupee-linked derivatives, regulating offshore trading platforms, and instructing banks on trading positions.  The authors believe these actions damage market liquidity, hinder trading, and undermine the RBI's primary role of ensuring financial system stability. They advocate for a market-driven approach to exchange rate management instead.

### [Why J&K assembly elections could end the domination of family-run parties](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-jk-assembly-elections-could-end-the-domination-of-family-run-parties-9529974/)

Jammu and Kashmir is set to hold its first assembly elections since becoming a Union Territory in 2019. The elections, spanning three phases, will see major political players including national parties like the BJP and Congress, and regional parties like the NC and PDP vying for power. 

The BJP holds a strong presence in the Jammu region, while the NC hopes to regain its influence in the Kashmir Valley. The emergence of a pro-separatist outfit, the Awami Ittehad Party (AIP), led by Engineer Rashid, adds another dimension to the political landscape. 

The NC's election manifesto, focusing on the restoration of Article 370 and the release of detainees, has sparked controversy, drawing criticism for its alleged separatist agenda and disregard for Jammu's marginalized communities. The elections are expected to be closely contested, with the outcome potentially shaping the future of the region.

### [How not to tax multi-national corporations](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/how-not-to-tax-multi-national-corporations-9529969/)

Recent years have seen a push for a more equitable global tax system.  After the global financial crisis, the OECD spearheaded an initiative that included  15 action points to address  profit-shifting by multinationals.  However, disagreements emerged around the allocation of taxing rights for large tech companies. This led to frustration among developing nations and ultimately a call for a UN-led global tax convention. Despite resistance from developed countries like the US and UK, 125 nations, including India, voted in favor of the convention. The UN has now released a draft convention, which aims to address tax avoidance and evasion, particularly by high-net-worth individuals While promoting sovereignty, it also seeks a fair allocation of taxing rights. However, the success of the UN-led initiative hinges on its ability to overcome both logistical challenges, such as duplicate efforts, and political hurdles, including divergent economic interests.

### [Time to reset the GST system](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/time-to-reset-the-gst-system-9529971/)

While GST revenues have been robust, many states oppose changing the five existing tax slabs. However, experts argue that when collections are strong, it's the perfect time to rationalize rates.  This includes reducing the number of slabs and reviewing the items under each one.  The current system is confusing and unfair, with discrepancies in rates for similar products like cement, milk, and edible oils.  Simplifying the slabs would promote economic growth and ultimately lead to higher tax revenues. States should also explore non-tax revenue sources like user charges and property registrations to boost the economy.

The article critiques the withdrawal of India's lateral entry scheme for government positions.  

It argues that the scheme, aimed at bringing in external professionals, is necessary to improve governance and address complex development challenges.

The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of building expertise in underrepresented groups and fostering a culture of service above all else within the government.

Her acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention emphasized unity and her commitment to representing all Americans. Harris's historic candidacy has energized the Democratic party and her campaign aims to appeal to both diverse and working-class voters.

Kamala Harris's nomination as the Democratic presidential candidate was met with enthusiasm, seen as a beacon of hope after four years of political turmoil. Her campaign has emphasized her competence and compassion, drawing parallels to a religious fervor. However, her acceptance speech veered towards demonizing former President Donald Trump, employing a "bogeyman" approach that risks alienating potential voters. While the Democrats attempt to frame Harris as a unifier, concerns remain about their ability to address social issues effectively. The election promises to be a closely fought battle, with both parties striving to connect with the anxieties and aspirations of American voters.

Gagni Porwal's song "Lovebomber baby," a heartfelt expression about a painful romantic experience, has unexpectedly become a viral sensation. What sets Porwal apart from past examples of viral "cringe" content, like Rebecca Black's "Friday," is the lack of malicious glee. Porwal's success might be attributed to the relatability of her story, as heartbreak is a universal experience. Additionally, her song offers a message of hope, demonstrating that even without a polished production or mainstream recognition, it's possible to create impactful art from personal experiences.

The Supreme Court's recent decision denying permission to remove a feeding tube from a patient in a vegetative state has sparked controversy regarding euthanasia in India.  While the court distinguishes between withholding life-prolonging measures in terminal cases and euthanasia, the decision raises ethical questions. Critics argue that prolonging life with no chance of recovery causes suffering for both the patient and their caregivers, and raises concerns about judges making medical decisions. The case highlights the need for legal clarity on end-of-life care in India, involving medical and ethical experts, and promoting open discussions about death and dying.

Minister Piyush Goyal raised concerns about predatory pricing practices by e-commerce platforms in India, highlighting the potential impact on small retailers.  While investigations have been conducted against platforms like Amazon, Flipkart, Shopee, and Ola, determining predatory pricing can be complex. A report by the Pahle India Foundation suggests that e-commerce, despite rapid growth, accounted for only 7.8% of total retail sales in 2022 and has created jobs and boosted sales for many vendors. The report also found that consumers benefit from increased choice and competitive pricing.  The Competition Commission should ensure fair play, transparency, and protection of competition in the growing e-commerce market.

Indian businesses are increasingly investing overseas, but often lack adequate assessment of political risk. Past incidents, like Tata's abandoned Bangladesh project and Adani's Sri Lanka troubles, highlight vulnerabilities. 

While Prime Minister Modi encourages global expansion, Indian firms rely heavily on personal connections and "political protection" rather than comprehensive risk analysis. This dependence on external factors, including government intervention, creates its own political risk.

Despite funding research institutions, Indian think tanks often focus on national security and foreign policy rather than country-specific economic and political risks. The lack of

investment in area studies and local expertise leaves businesses vulnerable to unforeseen political developments.  

A stronger emphasis on analyzing domestic politics and policies of target countries is essential for mitigating risks and ensuring successful overseas investment.

### [When PM Modi meets President Zelenskyy](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pm-modi-meets-president-zelenskyy-9527618/)

Prime Minister Modi's visit to Ukraine is a delicate move aimed at balancing India's relationships with Russia, China, and the West.  

Following a trip to Moscow that disappointed Western allies, Modi's visit to Kyiv seeks to restore India's image as a peaceful and principled player on the world stage. While India will likely call for peace dialogue, it is not expected to act as a mediator in the war. 

The visit presents opportunities to rekindle cooperation in areas like defense, technology, and energy. India and Ukraine share historical ties, despite past disagreements, and the war has created new avenues for collaboration. Ukraine needs to rebuild its defense industry, while India seeks to modernize its own arsenal by transitioning away from Soviet-era equipment.  
 
 Both countries are leaders in digital innovation, offering potential for cooperation in e-governance. The visit is a chance for India and Ukraine to forge a stronger partnership as they navigate the complexities of the current global landscape.

### [When a woman walks alone at night](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/when-woman-walks-alone-night-9527418/)

This article discusses the safety and mobility of women in cities, particularly highlighting the experiences of women in Delhi. The author recounts her personal experience as a young woman navigating the city and the changes in her behavior after dark.  She then describes the origin of safety audits conducted by women to assess safety concerns in public spaces and the subsequent advocacy work that led to various interventions aimed at improving women's safety.  

The article acknowledges the fear and limitations imposed on women due to violence and harassment, but emphasizes their continued determination to claim their right to public space and city life.  It uses the recent rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata as a stark example, demanding justice and systemic changes to ensure all women can live with dignity. The author concludes by emphasizing the importance of a new urban vision that prioritizes the needs and safety of women.

### [Centre’s lateral entry policy corrects a historical wrong](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/institutionalisation-lateral-entries-congress-9527403/)

The article argues that the Congress party's criticism of lateral entries in the bureaucracy is disingenuous and a tactic to deflect from its own past actions. 

It points out that the Congress has a history of making ad-hoc lateral appointments, often based on personal connections rather than merit, and that these appointments frequently lacked regard for social justice principles.  The article cites examples of Congress-era lateral entries, including those of prominent figures like Manmohan Singh and Nandan Nilekani, contrasting them with the Modi government's  emphasis on  ensuring  lateral entries  uphold  social justice and historical corrective measures. The writer suggests that the Congress is using the issue of lateral entries to gain political mileage, especially in light of their recent electoral losses.

"Stree 2: Sarkate Ka Aatank," a sequel to the 2018 successful horror-comedy, has exceeded expectations by crossing Rs 400 crore in its first week worldwide. The film capitalizes on audience familiarity with the world of Chanderi, where men are terrorized by a spirit, and delivers on the promise of action, humor, and spooky elements. Released at an advantageous time coinciding with a long weekend, it outperformed several big-budget movies earlier this year. The film highlights the importance of good storytelling and "rooted content" in attracting audiences, reminding the industry that entertaining stories with a unique perspective are what truly resonate.  While "Stree 2" leans towards humor and spectacle, it raises the question of whether future installments in the franchise will retain the social commentary and feminist themes present in the first film.

N T Rama Rao met with President Zail Singh and demanded the Governor's removal, the Bhaskara Rao ministry's dismissal, and his government's reinstatement. Opposition parties denounced the government's actions, while the government announced plans to create a new National Security Guard force to address extremist and terrorist activities.

We are experiencing an ironic "age of content" where an overwhelming abundance of material creates a sense of boredom. Research suggests that this isn't due to the quality of content, but rather our own behavior. The constant ability to switch between options and reject things instantly prevents true engagement and immersion.  We become victims of our own choices, influenced by the algorithms that profit from our short attention spans and endless scrolling. This cycle reinforces a culture of instant gratification and undermines the ability to fully appreciate any given piece of content.

The recent divergence between bank deposit and credit growth, with credit growth exceeding deposit growth, has raised concerns among policymakers.  The gap has led to banks relying more on short-term, non-retail deposits, which could lead to liquidity issues.  This trend is attributed to competitive investment avenues attracting household funds.  

The situation might intensify competition for deposits among banks, potentially driving up funding costs and impacting profitability.  It's been observed that banks are exploring innovative deposit schemes to attract funds. Credit offtake has been moderating, suggesting a possible alignment between credit growth and deposit growth. The RBI anticipates this trend to persist, although the duration is uncertain.

India's large and growing middle class makes it a lucrative target for multinational corporations.  Despite claims that Indians are price-sensitive,  the success of multiplex chains like PVR demonstrates a willingness to pay more for enhanced entertainment experiences.  

However, the recent tariff hike for mobile services by Jio, Airtel, and Vodafone, though still low compared to other nations, raises questions about price sensitivity in the telecom sector. While low prices have fueled  market disruption and consumer loyalty, the hike might prompt a reevaluation of the perceived value of service quality.

Prime Minister Modi's visit to Kyiv is a significant step for India, aiming to shape its engagement with Central Europe independent of the Russia-Ukraine conflict. 

India’s long-standing relationship with Russia, particularly from the Cold War era, influences its stance on the ongoing war. However,  India is increasingly recognizing the need to pursue its own interests and de-hyphenate its ties with Russia from those with Europe. 

Modi's visit is not about "compensating" for a recent trip to Russia but rather about fostering good relations with both countries. While India's role in peace talks is limited, the focus is on strengthening bilateral cooperation and discussing perspectives on resolving the conflict peacefully.

### [Why laws on sexual violence continue to be skewed against women](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sexual-violences-law-women-9526341/)

A recent rape and murder case in Kolkata highlighted the deep-rooted issue of sexual impunity in India. Despite legislative changes aimed at addressing gender justice, including the renumbering of the penal code and the introduction of the death penalty for rape, crimes against women remain rampant.  

These changes have failed to create a culture of deterrence, and the state continues to fall short in providing adequate support and safety for women. Resources are allocated towards male-centric forensics while neglecting basic necessities for survivors, like providing them with items necessary after their clothes are taken for analysis. 

The criminalization of protest and the de-funding of women's organizations further exacerbate the problem. The societal response is often fueled by patriarchal bias and exposes the selective and partisan nature of the justice system. The reliance on carceral approaches and the persistence of negative stereotypes surrounding rape perpetuate a cycle of violence and impunity.

The article criticizes the recent UPSC advertisement for lateral entry into government positions, arguing that the lack of reservation provisions perpetuates social inequality and marginalizes Dalits and ST communities. It contends that meritocratic ideals don't address systemic biases that disadvantage these groups, leading to their exclusion from decision-making bodies. The author calls for a more inclusive and equitable approach, urging for a review of the reservation policy and  transparent recruitment processes. They emphasize the importance of representation from marginalized communities to ensure diverse perspectives and counter the hegemonic dominance of certain social groups.

Questions asked in Parliament are increasingly being rejected under various pretexts, such as "sensitive nature" or "hypothetical propositions." This trend contradicts the historical practice of allowing a wider range of questions. 

The government's unwillingness to disclose information about the cost of the new Parliament building, internet shutdown orders, petroleum imports, and even the delay in conducting Census 2021 raises concerns about transparency. 

Furthermore, the quality of answers provided has also declined, often resorting to evasiveness and semantic gymnastics. This decline in parliamentary discourse weakens the ability of MPs to effectively scrutinize the executive branch, ultimately undermining democratic governance.

The author recalls past experiences of the hospital's squalid conditions and the broken sense of community among students.  This tragic event is placed within a larger context of anxieties surrounding education and competition for secure positions in India. The author cites instances of drowning deaths in a Delhi coaching center and the NEET question leak fiasco, pointing to the immense pressure and vulnerability of young aspirants for a better future. The article concludes by questioning the very purpose of education and training in a system where even those pursuing noble professions are unsafe, urging readers to consider the grim realities faced by aspiring doctors, engineers, and civil servants in India.

Despite his impressive record as a captain and coach in the IPL, his team suffered an unexpected ODI series loss to Sri Lanka. Gambhir, known for his intensity and egalitarian approach, faces the challenge of leading a team in a rebuilding phase, nurturing young talent, and managing the expectations of a demanding fan base.

The Indian government is grappling with perceptions of administrative inadequacy and exploring lateral entry from the private sector to address it. However, the article argues that this approach is misplaced. While lateral entry can be effective for specific, well-defined objectives, it's not a solution for the broader systemic issues within the civil service. 

The author contends that the core problem lies in the rigid, bureaucratic nature of the system itself, not the individuals serving within it.  They advocate for a fundamental shift in approach, drawing inspiration from models adopted by countries like Australia and New Zealand, while emphasizing the need for political ownership and coordination at both the national and state levels.

The report details instances of sexual harassment, lack of basic facilities, unfair remuneration, and threats. While it marks a significant step in acknowledging the issues, the report calls for more substantial action.  

Recommendations include enacting a law specific to women's concerns in the industry and establishing a dedicated tribunal to address their complaints. However, the report emphasizes the need for a fundamental shift in the industry's culture to effectively combat deeply entrenched sexism and power imbalances. It urges the industry to move beyond progressive content in films and implement real changes to ensure a safe and equitable work environment for all.

The recent cancellation of a lateral entry advertisement for 45 mid-level specialists by the Modi government, following controversies and criticism, highlights a trend of government backtracking on certain initiatives. While lateral entry has been advocated for bringing in fresh ideas and expertise, the government faced pushback concerning its potential to undermine reservation policies, particularly in light of recent electoral concerns. 

This incident underscores the need for the government to balance the demands for expertise with the principles of social justice.  The Modi government, with its reduced majority, needs to demonstrate a willingness to listen to dissenting voices, both from within its coalition and the opposition, to ensure better decision-making and more responsive policies.

The article argues that while laws regarding rape have been strengthened, the true issue lies in the lax treatment of other crimes against women. Dowry deaths, domestic violence, stalking, and harassment are often under-reported and inadequately punished, leading to a culture where violence against women is tolerated. The author highlights the shockingly low conviction rates in dowry death cases and the lenient bail norms for offenses like domestic violence. 

They emphasize the need for a comprehensive review of laws and judicial procedures to reflect the gravity of these crimes.  Stronger penalties, a stricter bail regime, and a fast-track justice system are crucial to deterring violence and instilling fear of the law. Until then, women will remain vulnerable and abusers emboldened.

### [‘Productive’ sleeping: Dream a little dream](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/productive-sleeping-dream-a-little-dream-9524394/)

Aldous Huxley's call to "dream pragmatically" is being challenged by modern science, particularly in California, where companies are exploring lucid dreaming for productivity enhancement. 

Lucid dreaming, the ability to be aware and control dreams, has a long history and is estimated to be experienced by half the population. While some have sought to harness its creative potential, recent projects aim to turn it into a tool for learning, knowledge acquisition, and even remote control of devices. 

This commodification of dreams raises ethical concerns, blurring the line between the mystical and the mundane, and potentially diminishing the inherent inspiration and creativity of the dreaming mind.

N T Rama Rao, the former chief minister of Andhra Pradesh, and his supporters arrived in Delhi to demonstrate their majority. Their attempt to meet the President was delayed by a technical issue. Opposition parties urged the President to remove the Governor and reinstate Rama Rao. Meanwhile, the former Governor faces legal action for alleged illegal activities during his tenure. 
The situation has created a political dilemma for Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who is facing criticism for the crisis and its impact on the Opposition.

### [PM Modi’s visit to Ukraine, Poland: India’s Central European foray](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pm-modis-visit-ukraine-poland-central-europe-india-9524102/)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Poland and Ukraine signifies India's growing interest in strengthening its ties with Central Europe.

This trip marks the first visit by an Indian Prime Minister to Poland since 1979 and to Ukraine since its independence.  It highlights Delhi's recognition of the region's strategic importance in the current geopolitical landscape, particularly given the ongoing war in Ukraine. 

India aims to build long-term partnerships with Poland and Ukraine, viewing its engagement with Central Europe as complementary to its relationship with Russia. 

The visits underscore India's broader strategy of elevating its diplomatic engagement with Europe, expanding beyond traditional ties with major European powers to include closer collaboration with Central European nations.   This shift is driven by factors such as Poland's economic growth and strategic location, and Ukraine's potential for post-war reconstruction.

### [Supreme Court verdict on sub-classification of SCs, STs is blinkered to historical discrimination of Dalits](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/supreme-court-verdict-sub-classification-sc-st-dalits-9523850/)

The Supreme Court's recent verdict on sub-categorization within reservation policies, while seemingly addressing the needs of vulnerable groups, may exacerbate social tensions among Dalits. Despite the state's claims of safeguarding marginalized communities, reservation policies have failed to achieve true diversity in institutions. The implementation of these policies is flawed, with reserved posts often remaining vacant.  

The Court's focus on economic mobility through reservations overlooks the pervasive social discrimination and violence faced by Dalits. It also fails to acknowledge the shrinking public sector and the dominant role of capitalism, which has largely excluded Dalits, Adivasis, and OBCs from economic development.  

A more effective approach would involve diversifying the economy to empower these communities as business leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators, ensuring they are stakeholders in India's growth.

### [Who is behind the violence in Bangladesh? It’s unlikely to be the students](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/violence-in-bangladesh-unlikely-students-9523696/)

The situation in Bangladesh following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has been described as chaotic.  The violence that erupted mirrors the events leading to the 1971 Liberation War, targeting members of the Awami League, religious minorities, and secular intellectuals.  

While student protests initially sparked the unrest, there is suspicion that Islamist groups, potentially including Jamaat-e-Islami, are orchestrating the violence, receiving support from external actors.  The destruction of landmarks associated with the 1971 Liberation War raises concerns about the preservation of Bangladesh's history and principles.

India,  worried about the unfolding events and potential threats to its security interests, has withdrawn non-essential staff from Bangladesh and suspended visa operations. 
 
The situation remains uncertain with calls for judicial investigations into the violence and speculation about constitutional changes and a potential new Army Chief.

Mahatma Gandhi's philosophy of non-violence found resonance in India's fight against environmental degradation. Landslides fueled by quarrying and construction are devastating communities, prompting calls for action. The Western Ghats Ecology Expert Panel's report, highlighting these issues, faced resistance but also generated public support. 

A successful people's movement in Chemban Mudi demonstrates the power of collective action. Advances in technology, particularly smartphones, empower commoners to advocate for their rights. The author proposes several steps for improving environmental sustainability and community well-being in Wayanad and other affected regions. These include localizing quarry management, prioritizing tribal-led homestays over tourist resorts, and establishing labor cooperatives for tea estates.  The author also advocates for revisiting Wildlife Protection Act regulations to ensure better protection of human lives and property.

### [Secular Civil Code will unify, not divide Indians](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/secular-civil-code-will-unify-not-divide-indians-9522698/)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call for a Secular Civil Code (SCC) during India's Independence Day speech has reignited debate. The SCC aims to unify the nation under a single legal framework for civil matters, ensuring equality for all citizens regardless of religion. 

Opponents argue it threatens religious freedom, but proponents emphasize that true secularism lies in equal treatment under the law. They point to discriminatory aspects of existing personal laws, particularly towards women, and cite examples of other democracies with successful SCC implementations. 

The SCC is seen as a step towards modernizing India's legal system, simplifying its framework, and reducing the burden on the judiciary. Supporters view it as a constitutional duty and a moral imperative for achieving social justice and fulfilling the vision of equality enshrined in the Indian Constitution.

India faces a multitude of challenges in governing its diverse population. While secularism, intended to ensure equality for all religions, has been met with resistance from some Hindus promoting "Hindutva,"  a stricter version of Hinduism. This emphasis on Hindu identity creates insecurity, reminiscent of Israel, surrounded by non-Jewish populations.

Furthermore, India grapples with deep-rooted caste divisions, economic disparity, and a growing youth population needing employment. The widening gap between the wealthy and the working class fuels social unrest, as “bread-and-butter economics” supersede GDP growth in public concern.  

India's future hinges on addressing these issues, moving beyond divisive rhetoric and prioritizing the needs of its citizens, particularly the working class, to ensure a secure and prosperous future.

This article critiques the politicisation of a rape and murder case in Kolkata.  It argues that while public outrage and calls for justice are understandable, such cases often become entangled with political agendas, ultimately reducing the victim to a political tool. 

The author points to the limitations of protest movements, highlighting their episodic nature, urban focus, and tendency to be overshadowed by  complex societal issues.  They contend that  the absence of tangible reforms in law enforcement and the judiciary prevents these movements from achieving lasting change. 

Furthermore, the article criticizes the West Bengal government's handling of the case, accusing them of avoiding responsibility, suppressing dissent, and prioritizing political expediency over the pursuit of justice. Ultimately, the author laments the pervasiveness of political instrumentalization of such sensitive crimes, emphasizing the enduring stain it leaves on society's collective conscience.

The article discusses the unusual unity displayed by fans of rival Kolkata football clubs, East Bengal and Mohun Bagan,  during a protest against the rape and murder of a young doctor. 

The rivalry between the clubs is deeply rooted in the history of Bengal and the divide between communities. However, in this instance, the shared sense of outrage and desire for justice united them. 

This act of solidarity highlights the power of collective action, demonstrating that seemingly insurmountable differences can be overcome when a common cause is pursued.  The author uses this example to illustrate the universal right to fight for justice, regardless of background or affiliation.

Kamala Harris has unexpectedly become the Democratic Party's presidential nominee after Biden's withdrawal. Despite facing challenges due to her performance in the 2020 primaries, Harris has gained momentum and is currently tied with or leading Trump in polls.  Democrats are hoping she can rally young and minority voters and counter the Republican attacks on their economic policies.  

However, the ongoing conflict in Gaza presents a significant challenge for the Harris campaign.  Protests against US support for Israel are expected at the Democratic National Convention, and growing dissatisfaction among some Democratic voters could impact the election.

This article argues that modern Indian political thought has declined, leading to a stagnation in political vision and action. 

The author points to a rich tradition of political thinkers in post-independence India who were deeply engaged in shaping the nation's future. However, this tradition gradually faded away, leaving a void in political discourse. While intellectuals still exist, their work is often disconnected from practical politics.  

The result, the author claims, is a diminished capacity for political imagination and a lack of compelling alternatives to the dominant political paradigm. Reclaiming the spirit of Indian political thought is presented as crucial for revitalizing Indian democracy.

Governor Jagmohan dismissed Farooq Abdullah's ministry in Jammu and Kashmir due to the withdrawal of support by 13 National Conference MLAs. The Governor swore in G M Shah's ministry.  The central government faces a dilemma regarding the dismissal of Andhra Pradesh chief minister N T Rama Rao, as he is set to demonstrate his majority before the President amidst deteriorating law and order in the state.

India recently successfully launched its Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV), a smaller, more agile rocket designed to carry smaller satellites. This event is significant because it opens up space access to universities, startups and individual innovators, diversifying the space sector beyond traditional players like ISRO and NASA.  

SSLV's rapid assembly time and lower cost make it ideal for the growing market of small satellites used in various sectors including weather forecasting, communications, and disaster management.  India aims to increase its share in the global space economy, currently at 2%, to 8% by 2033 through initiatives like SSLV and private sector involvement.

### [Outrage over reform in capital gains tax is overblown. Here’s why](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/capital-gains-tax-reform-outrage-overblown-explained-9522238/)

The Union Budget 2024-25 has sparked debate due to changes in capital gains tax, particularly the removal of inflation indexation  benefits for property sales. While these changes appear stringent, a comparative analysis reveals that India's capital gains tax regime remains relatively moderate compared to other G20 nations. 

The budget simplifies existing provisions by unifying holding periods for short-term and long-term capital gains, increasing the short-term capital gains tax rate, and introducing a flat long-term capital gains tax rate.  The removal of indexation aligns with international practices, with few countries currently offering this benefit.  

The reforms aim to create a simpler, more equitable tax structure, discouraging speculative trading and promoting long-term investments. The increased exemption limit for lower and middle-income groups aims to make the tax system more progressive. Although there may be short-term challenges, these changes have the potential to foster a more robust and fairer economic environment in the long run.

The article examines the public response to the rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata, highlighting the need for a critical analysis of the discourse surrounding such incidents. 

It argues that focusing solely on punishing the perpetrators ignores the systemic factors that enable and protect them. The article criticizes the failure of institutions to provide safety, the media's disregard for victim anonymity, and the government's suppression of dissent. 

It emphasizes the importance of questioning societal norms and structures that perpetuate gender-based violence and silence survivors. The writer stresses the need for sustained activism and political engagement to bring about meaningful change.

India's 78th Independence Day calls for reflection on achieved milestones and areas needing improvement to reach the goal of Viksit Bharat by 2047.  While India has made strides in food security since independence, China's rapid economic growth presents both opportunities and challenges. China's success in agriculture, driven by reforms and targeted support for farmers, has significantly boosted its per capita income. India can learn from China's approach, particularly in incentivizing production of pulses, which are both nutritious and environmentally friendly.  Addressing the challenge of nutritional security remains crucial, with efforts needed to improve the well-being of young children.  Further investments in research, irrigation, and value chain development are essential for ensuring sustainable food security in the face of climate change.

The Supreme Court ruled that states have the power to levy royalties on mining activities, overturning a previous 1989 judgment.  

The court applied this ruling retrospectively to 2004, the date of a separate ruling that signaled a potential change in policy. While this was done to clarify legal confusion, it has raised concerns about retrospective taxation. 

The court clarified that this isn't technically retrospective taxation as it upholds a legal position that was always viable, even if not recognized. States are now empowered to collect royalties from mining companies, leading to financial implications for the industry. This situation highlights the need for stable policy environments and the importance of  policymakers ensuring a balanced approach to mineral development within the federal system.

The recent conversation between Prime Minister Modi and Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh's chief advisor, highlights the importance of the India-Bangladesh relationship.  Both sides expressed willingness to move past past tensions and focus on shared goals like development and stability. While concerns remain in Delhi about the new government's legitimacy, there's a shared understanding of the need for cooperation.  

Both countries must be cautious in navigating this delicate period. India should encourage former Prime Minister Hasina to refrain from political activities on Indian soil, while Bangladesh should avoid extradition attempts that could strain relations. 


The stability of Bangladesh hinges on its ability to achieve internal reconciliation and address its contested history.  India's support for Yunus, the new government's leader, is crucial in mitigating the risk of further instability and violence.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's 11th Independence Day speech lacked the groundbreaking pronouncements that characterized his initial addresses. 

In contrast to his 2014 speech, which addressed sanitation and female empowerment with a direct and personal touch, this year's address felt more restrained.  The absence of a compelling "outreach moment" may reflect a loss of confidence due to recent electoral setbacks and a realization that key promises, like improved sanitation and reduced violence against women, remain largely unfulfilled. The speech focused on broader aspirations, such as a developed India by 2047, and addressed the controversial Uniform Civil Code, albeit cautiously, emphasizing a "secular" approach and the need for public discourse.

The article discusses the contentious issue of religious conversion in India. It argues that while the right to freedom of religion is enshrined in the Constitution, the issue of conversion remains a source of tension, particularly with the enactment of stricter anti-conversion laws.  

The author challenges the effectiveness of these laws and questions whether they truly address the root causes of conversion, which often involve socioeconomic factors. They argue that the laws create an environment of mistrust and can fuel communal conflict. 

The article concludes by invoking Mahatma Gandhi's vision of a tolerant and pluralistic India where religions coexist peacefully, urging a move away from legislation that impinges on individual religious freedom.

The recent murder of a resident doctor in Kolkata highlights the urgent need for nationwide legislation to protect healthcare workers in India.  Violence against doctors and other healthcare personnel has been increasing, leading to widespread calls for a central law. Although a draft bill was proposed, it was withdrawn due to concerns about similar requests from other professions. Healthcare workers face unique risks due to their constant interaction with the public, often during times of stress and emotional vulnerability. Several states have enacted their own laws, but a lack of uniformity creates loopholes and inconsistencies. Protections are crucial, not just during emergencies like pandemics, but for everyday safety. Healthcare workers are merely seeking the security necessary to perform their duties effectively and serve the public without fear. It is time for lawmakers and the public to recognize their vital role and support legislation that safeguards them.

A surge in suicides among medical students has prompted the National Medical Commission to address the alarming mental health crisis in the medical field. Surveys reveal high rates of mental health conditions and suicidal thoughts among students, highlighting the urgent need for policy interventions. While existing policies aim to prioritize mental health, implementation remains a challenge due to limited resources and a lack of clarity on strategies.  

India's experience combating HIV-AIDS offers valuable lessons for tackling mental health challenges.  Successful implementation of the National Aids Control Programme involved creating evidence-based interventions, engaging diverse stakeholders, addressing systemic issues, and prioritizing community-led approaches.  

Emulating these strategies, the government needs to invest in robust mental health infrastructure, implement community-based interventions, and ensure accessible and affordable care for all. Civil society plays a crucial role by providing research and evidence-based models for successful rehabilitation and care.

The Supreme Court's decision to allow sub-classification within Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) reservations has sparked debate. While there is consensus against applying a "creamy layer" exclusion to SCs and STs,  views on sub-classification are divided. Critics argue it will fragment the "pan-Dalit identity" and  highlight the limited impact of reservation, urging its effective implementation instead.  However, proponents argue that sub-classification is necessary to address the vast socio-economic disparities within SC communities and ensure that the most marginalized benefit from reservation. The demand for sub-classification stems from observations that welfare benefits often concentrate among numerically larger and politically organized SC groups.  Numerous commissions across India have recommended sub-categorization based on their findings, recognizing the internal disparities within the SC community.

However, they argue that true reform has been lacking in the past decade. While infrastructure projects have advanced and welfare programs have improved, governance has not effectively addressed issues such as corruption and the quality of education.

The SEBI saga involves allegations of financial impropriety within a business group. The doubters claimed the investments were illegitimate, prompting an investigation by SEBI and a subsequent inquiry by a Committee led by Justice Sapre. The Committee found issues with SEBI's investigation, noting changes in regulations and a lack of transparency concerning the ultimate beneficial owners of foreign investors.  Despite this, the Supreme Court upheld SEBI's actions and ordered the completion of its investigation. 

The matter resurfaced with allegations against SEBI Chairperson Madhabi Puri Buch,  concerning potential conflicts of interest due to past investments by her and her husband in entities under SEBI scrutiny.  Buch admits to the investments but claims they were made before her appointment at SEBI and were subsequently disposed of.  The core issue revolves around whether Buch disclosed these past connections to SEBI, the government, the Justice Sapre Committee, and the Supreme Court, and whether she recused herself from the investigations.

The South Asian University, established with ambitious goals of regional integration and academic excellence, has faced a downward spiral culminating in a recent controversy. The university, meant to be free from political interference, has been increasingly controlled by the Indian government, stifling academic freedom and independence. 

This control is evident in unjustified student and faculty suspensions, unlawful expulsions, and attempts to suppress protests.  The latest incident involved a doctoral research proposal that cited a critical statement made by Noam Chomsky about Prime Minister Modi. The university's overreaction, leading to disciplinary action against a professor, highlights a culture of fear and self-censorship. This situation jeopardizes the university's original vision and erodes trust among SAARC member countries.

The crime reveals the enduring power imbalances that make women vulnerable, even within institutions designed to provide safety. The incident exposes the gaps between the ideal of freedom and equality promised by democracy and its lived experience for women.  Furthermore, the efforts to conceal the crime and protect the hospital's reputation underscore the complicity of institutions in protecting perpetrators and perpetuating a culture of silence.

The draft nuclear doctrine, presented in 1999, outlined India's stance as a nuclear weapons state emphasizing transparent principles of credible minimum deterrence and a retaliation-only policy. These principles, while conceived in a changed strategic environment, remain largely relevant today.  

India's stance against  first use, supported by growing but carefully calibrated nuclear capabilities, helps maintain stability  despite ongoing threats from Pakistan and China. Debates around tactical nuclear weapons and  concerns about ambiguity are addressed by the doctrine's emphasis on robust second-strike capability and  clear communication of its intentions. 
 
 The draft doctrine's core tenets continue to serve as a foundation for India's nuclear posture, providing a beacon of stability amidst evolving global nuclear dynamics.

The author, reflecting on India's Independence, acknowledges the freedoms and opportunities enjoyed by their generation, a direct result of the sacrifices made by those who fought for independence.  

However, the author also points out a new kind of servitude that exists today, fuelled by a relentless pressure to succeed in a competitive job market. This pressure manifests in an obsession with goals, a constant striving, and anxiety.

Indian women activists, even over a century ago, campaigned for women's empowerment. They recognized the need for financial freedom for women to exercise their agency in a patriarchal society. Early organizations like the Women's Indian Association fought for better working conditions for women, including limitations on night work and maternity benefits. The All-India Women's Conference advocated for women's rights, including the recognition of unpaid household work and financial autonomy for women. While progress has been made, particularly in inheritance laws, many of these demands remain unfulfilled. The article urges continued efforts to achieve economic equality for women through financial security, recognition of unpaid labor, and overcoming persistent social barriers.

The upcoming Assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir, scheduled for September and October, mark a significant step towards restoring democratic processes after years of political stagnation. The elections, held five years after the abrogation of Article 370, are seen as an opportunity to address the democratic deficit and the concerns of the people. While there has been progress in areas like tourism and investment, challenges persist, including cross-border terrorism, economic dependence on the Centre, and concerns over jobs and land. 

It is crucial for the government to be responsive to the concerns of the young voters set to participate for the first time and work towards inclusive governance that ensures their voices are heard and their aspirations met.

A recent study by Anglia Ruskin University found that engaging in creative activities like arts and crafts can contribute to greater well-being than employment. While jobs can be a source of stress, hobbies offer the freedom to "fail" without consequence. The act of creating, regardless of the skill level, can bring joy and self-expression, benefiting mental health.  The study suggests that hobbies provide a valuable outlet for relaxation and stress relief, contributing to overall well-being.

The world just experienced its hottest July ever recorded, marking a significant shift in global climate patterns. While the cause is partially attributed to El Nino, the unprecedented temperature rise demands immediate action.  Scientists are now focusing on climate modeling, especially microclimate forecasting, to better understand and predict local weather variations. 

Increasing the density of meteorological stations and improving information sharing between countries are crucial steps to effectively adapt to these changing conditions. Collaborative efforts, like the UNFCCC's Lima Adaptation Knowledge Initiative, can play a vital role in mitigating the impact of extreme weather events. The urgency to adapt to a changing climate is undeniable, as illustrated by recent events like the Wayanad tragedy and the Pakistan floods of 2022.

Andhra Pradesh Governor Ramlal dismissed the Telugu Desam ministry led by N T Rama Rao and appointed N Bhaskara Rao as the new Chief Minister. Rama Rao claimed to still have majority support in the Assembly. 

This action triggered strong condemnation from opposition leaders and members of Parliament, who labeled it "politically immoral" and "constitutionally invalid." The Communist Party of India blamed Prime Minister Indira Gandhi for the dismissal, calling it "murder of democracy."

### [How Britain’s anti-immigrant riots backstab UK’s flailing economy](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/britain-anti-immigrant-riots-backstab-uks-flailing-economy-9517982/)

Recent public outrage following a tragedy in the UK was exploited by far-right groups to scapegoat immigrants and non-white people.  While economic woes fueled anger, the far-right blamed immigration for Britain's economic struggles, ignoring the impact of Brexit.  

Data shows that immigrants, particularly from outside the EU, filled the labor gaps created by Brexit. They stabilized key sectors and compensated for the loss of EU workers, contributing to the UK's economic recovery. The economic downturn is attributed to factors like reduced investment, inflation, and stagnant wages, issues that the right wing failed to address. Instead, they directed anger towards immigrants, deepening societal divisions. 

Experts argue that immigration is crucial for sectors like healthcare and housing, which are already strained. Blaming immigrants diverts attention from the government's mismanagement and further harms the working class.

The Indian government withdrew a second draft of the Broadcasting Bill that would have significantly expanded government control over online content. The initial and subsequent drafts drew criticism for seeking to subject online video creators, including those producing non-news content, to regulations similar to those governing traditional broadcasters.  

Concerns were raised that the Bill could be used to suppress dissenting voices and stifle creativity, particularly given the government's track record of utilizing IT regulations to limit free expression.  

Critics argue the Bill's intent, despite being labelled as promoting "ease of doing business and living," primarily benefits government-aligned media and curtails the reach of critical content. They also point out the futility of such efforts in the current climate of globalized content production and distribution, where creators can easily transcend geographical boundaries.

### [How state governments have undermined right to education](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/state-governments-undermined-right-to-education-9517293/)

The Right to Education (RTE) Act, passed in 2010, promised universal elementary education in India.  Despite initial progress, the implementation of the Act has faced numerous challenges. A recent Bombay High Court verdict highlighted the issue of state governments attempting to circumvent the RTE's provision requiring unaided private schools to reserve seats for children from economically weaker sections.  Arguments used to justify this include concerns over resource duplication and questioning the "absolute" nature of the RTE, suggesting a lack of commitment to the law by several state governments. 

The RTE mandates mixing children from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds, aiming to enhance learning and bridge social divides. This provision has been met with resistance from private schools who prefer separate sections or afternoon classes for economically weaker students. Despite efforts from some teachers to implement RTE's vision, teacher training remains a significant challenge, hindering the Act's true potential. The article concludes by expressing concern over the misuse of the RTE to exclude poor children from private schools through regulations that limit EWS admissions.

A recent artillery and drone attack in Myanmar's Rakhine province killed nearly 200 civilians, mostly Rohingya. While the Arakan Army, an ethnic Rakhine group, denies responsibility, many observers blame them for the atrocity and other attacks targeting the Rohingya in recent months.

A shrinking deposit base in India's banking system is raising concerns due to its potential impact on loan growth and the overall economy. 

Banks Traditionally rely heavily on deposits, especially core deposits, for stable funding. 

However, with deposit growth slowing, banks face limitations in extending loans, particularly to businesses. This could stifle investment and economic activity.

The trend is driven by factors like competition, technological advancements, and high inflation eroding the attractiveness of bank deposits compared to other investment options. 

This situation calls for policy interventions like deepening bond markets and encouraging banks to offer more competitive alternatives to savers.

Prime Minister Modi's Independence Day speech focused on his vision for a "developed India" by 2047, emphasizing the country's potential and urging citizens, particularly the youth, to seize the opportunities.  While reiterating his government's commitment to fulfilling the aspirations of the people, Modi acknowledged the uniqueness of his third term and the need for his coalition government to listen to diverse voices.  

The speech featured significant shifts in its approach. Notably, Modi reiterated the Uniform Civil Code (UCC) as a constitutional goal, urging a nationwide debate and framing it as a  "secular" civil code. This marked a departure from the BJP's previous stance on the UCC.  Furthermore, Modi announced plans to induct 1 lakh young, politically unconnected individuals into politics to bring fresh ideas and inclusivity to governance.  These pronouncements signaled a potential evolution in the BJP's political discourse, emphasizing inclusivity and sensitivity.

### [PM’s I-Day speech: Viksit Bharat, nationalism and contradictions](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/pms-i-day-speech-viksit-bharat-nationalism-contradictions-9515885/)

This article analyzes the political implications of the Prime Minister's Independence Day speech, focusing on his vision of "Viksit Bharat" and its underlying message about national unity. The author argues that the speech frames diversity as a set of contradictions that need to be resolved for economic progress, a strategy reminiscent of colonial-era justifications for rule. 

This approach, the author contends, contradicts the spirit of anti-colonial nationalism which celebrated diversity as a source of strength.  The author further criticizes the emphasis on "reform" as a solution to national challenges, arguing that it undermines the importance of debate and dissent in shaping a just and inclusive society. Drawing from the example of a 1959 film, the author highlights a more inclusive understanding of national identity that embraces diversity rather than viewing it as a threat.  Ultimately, the article calls for a political imagination that recognizes the value of diverse perspectives in building a strong and equitable nation.

This open letter addresses a concerning broadcasting practice in cricket: describing on-field errors as "suicidal" or "committing hara-kiri." 

The author argues this trivialises suicide, a serious public health crisis, especially given cricket's history of mental health challenges among players. The letter highlights the tragic loss of several cricketers to suicide and the growing awareness of mental health issues within the sport. It also cites examples of how language can shape public perception of suicide and  urges broadcasters to adopt a more sensitive and responsible language policy. The author proposes mandatory training for broadcasters on this issue, drawing parallels with the recent shift towards gender-neutral language in cricket.

The Associated Press Stylebook advocates for just an apostrophe after names ending in "s," while others argue for an additional "s," citing clarity.

Through their collective struggles, Indians made themselves the protagonists of constitutionalism even before its official enactment, demonstrating that the Constitution was more than just a set of rules; it was a living embodiment of their aspirations for freedom, equality, and justice.

The coaching industry in India, despite concerns and regulations, continues to prioritize profit over student well-being. This has led to several tragedies and a system that focuses on rote learning and exam pressure rather than holistic development. 

The education system needs to shift its focus from cramming information to nurturing individual potential and fostering a love for learning. Schools should play a more central role in preparing students for competitive exams while also providing a well-rounded education that caters to diverse interests and talents.

The Supreme Court's recent caste classification verdict has sparked debate about its effectiveness in promoting equality. While the intention to expand reservation benefits is commendable, the verdict's loopholes may hinder democratic progress. 

Critics argue that prioritizing political equality over social and economic equality has marginalized scheduled castes and tribes. The success of affirmative action hinges on addressing economic inequality and dismantling the power structures of Brahmanical hegemony.  

Furthermore, the 50% reservation cap and the absence of quotas in the private sector remain major obstacles. The judiciary's inconsistent stance on affirmative action, evident in contrasting rulings across states, further complicates the issue.  

Addressing caste-based discrimination requires a multi-pronged approach, including a caste census, scientific data-driven policymaking, and a commitment to "annihilation of caste" by ensuring equal opportunities for all marginalized groups.

While both men are successful in their respective fields, they struggled to engage in a compelling discussion.  Their reliance on familiar tactics like demagoguery and name-calling ultimately made the interview lackluster.

### [The post-Mandal moment is here — and it calls for a new politics](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-post-mandal-moment-is-here-and-it-calls-for-a-new-politics-9512649/)

The Supreme Court's recent ruling allowing states to sub-classify SCs and STs for reservations has sparked both political avoidance and criticism from advocates of the reservation policy.  This ruling reflects the complexities and uncertainties surrounding the post-Mandal era.

Mandal, a concept encompassing caste politics, evolved in two phases. The pre-Mandal period witnessed struggles against caste, influenced by figures like Jyotiba Phule and Periyar, culminating in the recognition of backward castes in electoral politics from 1967 onwards. 

The post-Mandal phase, marked by the judicial debate and implementation of reservations, saw a shift toward viewing numerical representation as the sole solution to social injustice. This approach, while reinforcing the reservation regime, arguably overshadowed the broader goals of dismantling caste-based hierarchies.

The ruling raises critical questions about the effectiveness and future trajectory of reservation policy. 

 It necessitates a reassessment of the social blocs on which reservations are based, considering their evolving nature and internal divisions. The challenges of addressing new power asymmetries beyond the confines of caste, class, and power require fresh approaches and political discourse.

### [RBI employment data should be read with a caveat](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rbi-employment-data-should-be-read-with-a-caveat-strap-considering-the-methodological-limitations-of-the-9512681/)

The KLEMS data, often cited to support claims of robust job creation in India, relies on projected population figures and worker-population ratios (WPR) derived from employment surveys. The methodology has limitations, including potential overestimation of labor force due to high projected population growth, especially in rural areas, and the inclusion of subsidiary employment, often involving unpaid family workers. 

Concerns arise about the temporal comparability of WPR data shifting from the Employment-Unemployment Surveys (EUS) to the Periodic Labour Force Surveys (PLFS), and the use of projected population figures from the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, which may be inflated.  Comparisons with data from the Annual Survey of Unincorporated Sector Enterprises (ASUSE) further cast doubt on the accuracy of employment figures. Given these methodological issues, claims of significant job creation based solely on KLEMS data warrant critical examination.

### [Express View on Muhammad Yunus government: Keep the social peace](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/express-view-on-muhammad-yunus-government-keep-the-social-peace-9512651/)

Following the ouster of Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh now faces a period of uncertainty. Muhammad Yunus, the Nobel Laureate economist, has been tasked with leading the interim government. His primary challenge lies in uniting the deeply divided country and restoring peace.

The recent protests, while ostensibly against Hasina's regime, have taken on a dangerous communal turn with increased attacks on the Hindu minority.  

Addressing this violence and ensuring the safety of minorities is a top priority for Yunus. The task is further complicated by the absence of the Awami League, Hasina's party, from the interim government. Yunus must now find ways to engage all stakeholders, including the Awami League, to heal the nation's wounds.  Bangladesh needs stability and unity, and the onus is on Yunus to guide the country through this turbulent period.

### [Kolkata doctor’s rape and murder shows how we fail women — yet again](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/kolkata-doctors-rape-and-murder-shows-how-we-fail-women-yet-again-9512652/)

Two recent incidents highlight the persistent issue of women's safety in India. The death of a trainee doctor in Kolkata after a sexual assault and the lifelong vegetative state of Aruna Shanbaug, assaulted decades ago, underscore the failure to adequately protect women, despite pronouncements of female empowerment. 

The death in Kolkata exposes  inadequate security measures within medical institutions, including a lack of on-call rooms and malfunctioning CCTV cameras. The widespread underutilization of the Nirbhaya Fund, established after the 2012 Delhi gangrape, further illustrates the disconnect between promises and action. While demanding justice is crucial, the focus should be on addressing the systemic issues that perpetuate violence against women, ensuring safe workplaces, and fulfilling commitments to equality.

### [C Raja Mohan writes: Bangladesh and the ‘foreign hand’ bogey](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bangladesh-student-protests-the-foreign-hand-bogey-9512007/)

The article critiques the theory that a US-backed coup orchestrated by Muhammad Yunus ousted Sheikh Hasina from power in Bangladesh. It argues that this conspiracy theory ignores the real reasons behind Hasina's downfall, namely her own political missteps and growing unpopularity. 

The author points out that Hasina’s authoritarian tendencies, rigged elections, and economic mismanagement created anti-regime sentiment, which  culminated in the student movement’s protests.  

The article further argues that attributing Hasina's loss solely to external forces reflects a failure of Indian strategic thinking and overlooks the complexities of Bangladeshi politics. It suggests that India should instead focus on cooperating with the new Bangladeshi government while supporting the democratic aspirations of the student movement.  


The author acknowledges Hasina's significant contributions to Bangladesh's development and her strong relationship with India. Finally, they emphasize the need for continued collaboration between India and the US in the region, especially given the current political instability in Bangladesh and Myanmar.

The article discusses the allure and exploitation within India's competitive Civil Services Examination (CSE) ecosystem, specifically focusing on Old Rajinder Nagar (ORN) in Delhi.  The author, an IAS officer, recounts their personal experience moving to ORN and enrolling in a costly coaching institute, realizing the exorbitant fees provided no better value compared to readily available resources. 

The article criticizes the coaching industry's overhyped promises and exploitation of aspiring candidates, particularly those from less privileged backgrounds.

The author highlights the harsh living conditions in ORN, coupled with unrealistic expectations fueled by profit-driven institutions.  

The article concludes with a call to action, urging aspirants to rely on official UPSC guidelines and resources, questioning the narratives surrounding coaching institutes and popular locations. It emphasizes the importance of individual dedication and original thinking over external pressures.

This article explores the use of Guru Dutt's film "Pyaasa" as a parallel to Plato's "Allegory of the Cave" in a Creative Writing classroom. The author compares Dutt's portrayal of a neglected poet, Vijay, with the prisoners in the cave who mistake shadows for reality.  Vijay's rejection by society mirrors the prisoners' inability to perceive true reality beyond the confines of their cave. The article argues that both Plato and Dutt challenge conventional thinking, prompting audiences to question the nature of truth and the influence of power structures. By showcasing Vijay's poignant song, "yeh duniya agar mil bhi jaaye toh kya hai," the author emphasizes the importance of art and introspection over material wealth and societal validation. Ultimately, the article advocates for a more philosophical approach to creative writing that encourages deep contemplation and questioning of societal norms.

The recent instability in Bangladesh is a result of deep-seated fault lines within the country.  

These include a conflict between secularism, Islamic identity, and Bengali popular culture. Historical divisions stemming from the 1971 War of Liberation, particularly regarding India's role, further exacerbate tensions. Public perception of India is often negative, influenced by propaganda and a belief that India's support came at a cost. 

Bangladesh also struggles with unstable civil-military relations. The military's involvement in commercial activities and its politicization create a sense of unease. These internal divisions contribute to the current turmoil, including attacks on minorities and the government's inability to effectively manage the situation.

The Indian government recently waived clinical trials for certain drug categories approved in developed nations, aiming to expedite access to innovative therapies like those for Alzheimer's, cancer, and autoimmune disorders. This move could benefit both patients and pharmaceutical companies by reducing costs and timelines. 

However, ensuring affordability remains crucial.  The government should consider expanding healthcare safety nets and exploring state procurement of novel drugs to minimize the financial burden on patients.  Promoting domestic research through incentives and ease of business is also essential, as India aims to move beyond its generic drug stronghold and contribute to developing new drug molecules.

Despite disagreements over border killings and water sharing, India and Bangladesh have made significant progress in strengthening bilateral ties in recent years, encompassing areas like security, trade, and energy.

Bangladesh's remarkable socio-economic development and successes in sectors like microfinance have been commended by India. Moving forward, both nations need to address outstanding issues through cooperation and diplomacy, focusing on shared challenges like poverty, unemployment, and climate change. The hope is for a future marked by mutual trust and progress, building on the foundations laid in recent years.

The Supreme Court ruled that the right to a speedy trial is a fundamental right protected by Article 21 of the Constitution. This decision, while not introducing new legal principles, carries significant weight as the Court acted upon its stated position and clarified its application within the context of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).  

The judgement, which  freed Manish Sisodia after 17 months in jail, highlights the Court's criticism of both the state and the judiciary for delays in trials. The Court emphasized that bail is the rule and imprisonment the exception, urging lower courts to adhere to this principle and considering the length of incarceration without trial. The case underscores the importance of safeguarding individual liberty and ensuring that legal proceedings are conducted fairly and expeditiously.

With  favorable weather conditions, the upcoming rabi cropping season also appears promising. The surplus monsoon and absence of heat waves are expected to ease food inflation, which has been a concern for the past few months. This could allow the government to ease restrictions on exports and stock limits for cereals, sugar, and pulses.

The article raises questions about Buch's transparency and recusal from investigations involving the group, given her personal financial ties.

The Waqf Amendment Bill, 2024 has sparked anxiety within a section of the Muslim community. However, it's important to analyze the proposal objectively as this is not the first time the waqf law is being amended.  Previous amendments in 1913, 1930, 1995, and 2013, along with recommendations from the Sachar Committee and a Joint Parliamentary Committee, highlight that reforms to waqf administration have been a long-standing concern. 

The government has received numerous grievances from Muslims regarding waqf property encroachments, mismanagement, and delays in registration.  Furthermore, the vast potential of waqf properties for socio-economic development, considering their status as public institutions and the largest landholders after Railways and Defence, necessitates improvements in their administration. International examples such as Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and others demonstrate the successful regulation and public engagement with waqf properties by governments. 


Therefore, the debate on waqf reforms should be based on facts, experience, and a commitment to social justice and gender equity.

### [Antitrust deja vu: Ruling against Google is reminiscent of a similar one against Microsoft in 2001](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/google-antitrust-ruling-microsoft-9509449/)

The author reflects on Microsoft's historical monopolistic practices, referencing a 2001 ruling against the company for leveraging its dominance in the OS market to stifle browser competition.  Drawing parallels to the recent antitrust ruling against Google, the author argues that despite legal challenges, technology giants like Microsoft and Google have deeply ingrained themselves in our digital lives, making it difficult to dislodge them. 

The author contends that in emerging markets, access to technology is often facilitated through piracy, a factor not adequately addressed by anti-competition law.  Ultimately, the author suggests that the future threat to Google's dominance may not come from competing search engines but from the emergence of generative AI.

K Natwar Singh, a prominent figure in India's Foreign Service, transitioned seamlessly into politics, becoming the External Affairs Minister. Known for his strong connections with influential figures, including the Nehru-Gandhis and literary personalities, he navigated international relations with finesse.  Serving as India's representative at the UN Decolonisation Committee fostered enduring bonds with African freedom fighters.

Vinesh Phogat's journey to the Paris Olympics mirrored Rocky's determination, with her striving to "go the distance" both in the ring and against systemic injustices. Her fight for justice extended beyond her personal experience, resonating with countless women who saw their own struggles in her battle against the Wrestling Federation of India president, who was accused of sexual assault. 

While her historic win against the defending champion was a significant victory, her subsequent disqualification sparked outrage and highlighted the cultural challenges women face in India. Her story transcends a simple quest for a medal, representing a broader struggle for dignity and recognition.  While a medal can serve as consolation, the real challenge lies in dismantling the systems that perpetuate injustice and empower women to pursue their dreams without facing undue burdens.

Recent political shifts in Afghanistan and neighboring South Asian countries like Bangladesh and Maldives have dealt a blow to India's foreign policy interests. These unexpected changes raise questions about whether India's foreign policy and security establishments were adequately prepared or caught unaware. 

India's National Security structure has evolved significantly since 1998, with the establishment of bodies like the National Security Council and National Security Advisor (NSA). These institutions aim to coordinate strategic and security functions. However, concerns have been raised about potential "turf" issues between different agencies and the influence of these issues on decision-making. There's a need to scrutinize whether the failures stem from structural inadequacies, misjudgments, or both.

This Independence Day, India faces a crucial moment for its democracy.  The recent electoral result, which significantly reduced the ruling party's majority, has underscored the importance of safeguarding democratic values.  

The government, accustomed to unchallenged authority, is now encountering a more assertive opposition, demanding greater accountability and freedom from perceived arrogance.  This new dynamic is forcing the government to adapt and engage in a less centralized and more transparent manner, as evidenced by the referral of a controversial bill to a parliamentary committee.  

However, challenges remain. Instances of partisan behavior from the ruling side, a hardening stance on religious autonomy, and the use of legal provisions to target political opponents raise concerns about backsliding on democratic norms.  Simultaneously, the judiciary's recent bail decision for a senior opposition leader offers a glimmer of hope for an independent institution acting as a check on governmental power. 
 
India continues to strive for a balance between its democratic traditions and the evolving political landscape.

The author suggests several measures to address democracy deficits, including term limits, resignation clauses for leaders facing discontent, and a vibrant parliamentary debate.  The article concludes by expressing sadness over the loss of life in Bangladeshi protests, emphasizing the high cost of neglecting democratic principles.

### [Half-truths and twisted facts about the RSS](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/half-truths-twisted-facts-rss-9506523/)

The article defends the Modi government's decision to lift the ban on government employees participating in RSS activities. It argues that this action, along with other measures, is part of decolonizing India.  

The author criticizes Pawan Khera's article, claiming it distorts history by ignoring the Nehru government's alleged persecution of the RSS and highlighting Nehru's personal animosity towards the organization. It also points to Sardar Patel's views on the RSS, asserting that he considered it a patriotic organization. 

The article further challenges Khera's accusations of undue favoritism towards the RSS, drawing attention to the Rajiv Gandhi Foundation's acceptance of funds from various sources including the Chinese government. It concludes by drawing a contrast between the Congress's past and present, suggesting Rahul Gandhi's party has adopted a more leftist and adversarial stance.

Pakistan celebrated a historic moment when Arshad Nadeem secured the country's first Olympic gold medal in javelin throw since 1984. Nadeem's victory, achieved despite limited resources and funding, has sparked calls for increased government support for athletes.  

The fifth anniversary of the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir was marked by renewed debate. Pakistan condemned India's move, highlighting the need for a dialogue to resolve the Kashmir issue. In the UK, a stabbing incident at a dance studio, initially linked to a Muslim immigrant, fueled Islamophobia and prompted concerns about the rise of far-right sentiments.   

Protests in Bangladesh over job quotas led to Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fleeing to India, raising questions about the stability of the Bangladeshi government and its implications for regional dynamics.

The article discusses India's rise in international hockey, analyzing the factors contributing to the team's success. While acknowledging the improvement in sporting infrastructure and talent development, the author emphasizes the importance of a deeper understanding and appreciation of sports among the general public. 

Drawing from her experience watching the Olympics, the author highlights the German fans' informed and analytical approach to the game. She contrasts this with the tendency in India to either idolize or criticize athletes without a nuanced understanding of the sport itself. 

Ultimately, the author argues that for India to become a true sporting nation, citizens need to engage with sports beyond simply cheering for their teams. Experiencing and understanding the nuances of various sports will foster a deeper respect for athletes and contribute to a more informed and supportive sporting culture.

Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee's involvement in communist politics stemmed from the vibrant intellectual and cultural environment of Bengal, combined with the party's strong organizational structure and commitment to land reforms. As part of the Left Front government, he played a crucial role in implementing policies that addressed economic disparity, strengthened participatory democracy, and boosted agricultural growth. However, his later decision to attract private industrial investment,  a departure from the party's traditional stance, led to alienation of the peasantry and ultimately contributed to the Left Front's decline. Despite this, Buddhadev Bhattacharjee's legacy remains significant for his championing of land rights, fostering grassroots politics, and promoting dialogue with internal resident groups through autonomous councils.

### [SC/ST Sub-quota red lines and red herrings](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sc-st-sub-quota-red-lines-and-red-herrings-9505474/)

The recent Supreme Court verdict on sub-quotas within the Scheduled Castes (SC) and Scheduled Tribes (ST) reservations has sparked debate. 

Supporters of social justice argue that the verdict, while seemingly concerning diluting reservation,  actually strengthens affirmative action by focusing on the needs of the most disadvantaged communities within these categories. Some criticisms against the ruling, focused on legal and political grounds, are deemed inaccurate and lacking evidence. 

The article highlights specific concerns regarding the potential misuse of sub-classification for political gains and the unintended consequences of applying the "creamy layer" doctrine to SCs and STs.  

It suggests focusing on addressing these flaws in the judgment rather than rejecting the notion of sub-quotas altogether.  Long-term solutions, such as enhancing reservation percentages, removing the 50% ceiling, and broadening the scope of social justice initiatives beyond public sector jobs, are also emphasized. Ultimately, the article urges a nuanced discussion that addresses the complexities of the verdict and its implications.

Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's long-serving prime minister, recently faced unprecedented protests from young citizens  due to economic hardships and unrest triggered by the reinstatement of a controversial quota system for government jobs. Despite Bangladesh's significant economic growth under Hasina,  inequality widened, unemployment rose, and cost of living soared, leading to resentment among the youth. Protests, initially against the quota system, escalated into a larger movement against Hasina's government.  The government's heavy-handed response,  labels the protests as "terrorism," and deployment of the ruling party's student wing against agitating students further inflamed the situation.

The Supreme Court granted bail to Manish Sisodia, former Delhi deputy Chief Minister, after he spent over a year and a half in jail without conviction. The court emphasized that bail is the norm and jail an exception, highlighting the importance of speedy trials to uphold the right to life and liberty.  

The judgment also states that the right to bail should be considered in cases of significant delay coupled with prolonged incarceration. The court expects trial courts and High Courts to adhere to the "bail is the rule, jail is the exception" principle while considering bail applications under both the CrPC and PMLA. This comes as the right to bail faces pressure, particularly in money laundering cases. 


The court acknowledged the state's assurance that the trial would be concluded within 6-8 months, but also recognized the impracticality of such a timeline given the volume of witnesses and documents.  The judgment underscores the importance of sharing all relevant evidence, including potentially exculpatory material, to ensure a fair trial.

### [SC verdict on subclassification of caste-based reservation will worsen reality of the Dalit community. Here’s why](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sc-verdict-on-subclassification-of-caste-based-reservation-will-worsen-reality-of-the-dalit-community-heres-why-9505463/)

The Supreme Court's verdict allowing sub-classification within Scheduled Castes/Scheduled Tribes and introducing a creamy layer concept is highly problematic.  The judgment ignores the severe social realities faced by a vast majority of Dalits who struggle for basic survival and are unable to benefit from reservation. The court overlooks the fact that government posts reserved for SCs/STs remain vacant due to a lack of eligible candidates, often cited as a consequence of  systemic disadvantages.  

Equating the OBC creamy layer with Dalit exclusion from reservation is illogical given the distinct social and economic positions of the two groups. Sub-classifying Dalits will only exacerbate existing inequalities and create further division.   

The judgment disregards the persistent social stigma and "camouflaged untouchability" faced by Dalits, regardless of their economic status, which remains a primary justification for reservation. The court's decision also violates constitutional provisions that clearly define the process for identifying Scheduled Castes and prohibits any subsequent modifications.

The author believes that India's continued support for the new leadership in Bangladesh is crucial to prevent further instability. While highlighting the importance of protecting minority rights, particularly the Hindu community, the author urges India to avoid focusing solely on this issue, which could complicate relations. 

The author suggests that India should understand the student-led revolution in Bangladesh, engage with its leaders, and review its own policies that failed to anticipate the political turmoil.  They emphasize that Bangladesh is not "India's to lose" but "India's to win" through constructive engagement, emphasizing the need for India to shed any illusions of regional hegemony and build genuine support through diplomacy and economic cooperation.  Despite the current crisis, the author expresses optimism about the resilience of India-Bangladesh relations, with strategic patience and empathy playing key roles in navigating the situation.

Phogat and other wrestlers bravely exposed allegations against the then-WFI president, Brij Bhushan Singh, leading to a prolonged battle for justice. Despite facing backlash and hostility, Phogat persevered and achieved remarkable success in the Olympics. 

Her disqualification, however, has raised serious questions about the fairness of the system and the government's handling of the situation. The public is demanding answers and accountability, highlighting a larger issue of systemic injustice faced by athletes, especially women.

### [How uncertainty of food inflation affects RBI’s policy going forward](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/food-inflation-rbi-policy-9503587/)

The RBI Monetary Policy Committee has kept policy rates unchanged, acknowledging market expectations but noting uncertainty about future actions. Food inflation, a significant component of the CPI basket, remains elevated due to climatic factors. While core inflation is subdued, high food prices impact household expectations, complicating the RBI's policy stance.

The RBI aims for a 4% CPI inflation target, but food inflation volatility poses a challenge. A strong monsoon may moderate food prices, but achieving the target remains a challenge. The RBI projects average FY25 inflation at 4.5%, with growth anticipated at 7.2%.

Global economic conditions are uncertain, with geo-political tensions and monetary policy divergence among countries.  The RBI is monitoring bank deposit growth and credit risk, noting the diversion of household savings towards other asset classes.  The RBI is likely to assess food inflation trends and could consider a shallow rate cut later in the year if food inflation moderates.

The Blair Witch Project, released in 1999, ingeniously blurred the lines between fact and fiction, capitalizing on the early internet's naivety. The film's "found footage" style, supported by a persuasive online campaign featuring fabricated evidence, created an unsettling ambiguity for viewers.

The RBI maintained its interest rates and focus on withdrawing accommodation in its August meeting. While headline inflation rose to 5.08% in June due to food price surges, the RBI anticipates moderation in the second quarter, projecting full year inflation at 4.5%. 

Growth prospects remain strong, enabling the MPC to prioritize inflation control. High food inflation, particularly in cereals, pulses, and vegetables, poses a risk of fueling household inflation expectations and potentially spilling over to core inflation.  

Despite this, core inflation remains subdued, encouraging the RBI's continued disinflationary stance. Global trends suggest that central banks are considering interest rate cuts, but the RBI awaits further clarity on food inflation's trajectory before making policy adjustments at its October meeting.

Weight management in sports, particularly wrestling, involves careful strategies to fit within weight categories. Athletes often employ extreme measures to shed weight before competitions, such as excessive workouts, fasting, and dehydration.  This practice, while effective for short-term weight loss, can be detrimental to an athlete's health, leading to muscle loss, injury, and psychological issues.  The weight-loss methods commonly employed can lead athletes into a catabolic state, where their bodies begin breaking down muscle for energy. Despite the risks,  athletes continue to engage in these practices to gain a competitive advantage. The case of Vinesh Phogat, who narrowly missed her weight limit, highlights the potential for complications and the delicate balance between training and health.

The Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana (PM-JAY), launched in 2018, aimed to improve healthcare coverage for India's poorest population. An analysis of recent household expenditure survey data shows that while coverage of public health insurance programs increased for the poorest population quintiles since 2018, it remains low, with less than 30% covered.  Furthermore, the utilization of public health insurance among covered individuals remains low. The data also reveals that while the burden of out-of-pocket expenditure (OOPE) for inpatient care has decreased for the poorest populations, they still incur significant costs.  



Despite some progress, the survey indicates that India is still lagging in achieving Universal Health Coverage through targeted public health insurance. Key challenges remain in expanding coverage to the intended beneficiaries and ensuring robust financial protection, particularly for the poorest populations.

### [Reducing the poor’s health burden](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ayushman-bharat-india-poor-9501487/)

This analysis examines the vulnerability of India's bottom 50% population to medical shocks, particularly hospitalisation, using data from the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey (HCES) 2022-23. 

It reveals a positive trend: the proportion of households experiencing hospitalisation has increased, indicating improved healthcare access.  Interestingly, while overall health expenditure has risen slightly for households without hospitalisation, the share consumed by hospitalisation has declined significantly. This suggests hospitalisation is becoming more affordable. 

Furthermore, the analysis shows a decrease in the likelihood of households facing a decline in consumption status due to hospitalisation costs. This improvement is particularly pronounced in rural areas and for households with young children and elderly members.  The study attributes these positive developments to public health policies like Ayushman Bharat Yojana, aimed at mitigating the financial burden of hospitalisation for the poor.

### [Why accusations of witchcraft persist in India](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/witchcraft-accusations-india-9501493/)

India is grappling with an issue of witch-hunting, despite strides in development. While global awareness of the problem is increasing, India faces a unique challenge. Though most incidents occur in rural areas, witch-hunting remains a serious concern, documented by the NCRB.  

Between 2009 and 2019, the UN recorded 20,000 cases of harmful witch-related practices across 60 countries, including India. Despite various state-specific laws aiming to combat this practice, implementation remains a challenge. 

Low prosecution rates, lenient penalties, and a lack of clarity regarding the intent of the legislation hinder effective action. The issue requires a multifaceted approach, encompassing education, awareness campaigns, and reforms within the criminal justice system.  It also demands a clear distinction between the practice of witchcraft and the accusation of witchcraft, which often leads to violence and persecution.

The Union Budget 2024-25 proposed a review of the Income Tax Act to simplify its provisions and reduce tax disputes. One significant proposal was to simplify capital gains taxation by introducing a flat tax rate of 12.5% across all asset classes, while eliminating the indexation benefit for property, gold, and unlisted assets.  This sparked criticism, leading the government to amend the proposal. Investors now have the option to choose between the lower tax rate of 12.5% without indexation or the existing 20% tax rate with indexation for properties acquired before July 23, 2024.  The government's aim is to provide clarity and reduce tax uncertainties for individuals.

The concept of Waqf stems from Islamic religious beliefs, involving the dedication of property for charitable purposes.  It is a form of religious charity, not an obligation, and its history is deeply rooted in legal frameworks. The proposed amendments to the Waqf Act, however, raise concerns. They grant extensive government control over Waqf properties, which are considered private and self-acquired by Muslims.  Critics argue that this  oversteps constitutional guarantees, particularly regarding the management of religious properties and the rights of Muslim citizens. 


The amendments also introduce impediments to the creation of new Waqfs and threaten existing ones through the concept of adverse possession. These measures are seen as undermining the autonomy of Waqf institutions and creating vulnerabilities for the Muslim community.

Bangladesh is experiencing political turmoil following student-led protests that escalated into demands for the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The protests, initially focused on job-quota concerns, reflected a deeper discontent stemming from Bangladesh’s history of cyclical political violence and party rivalry.  The situation led to Hasina’s resignation and the establishment of an interim government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus. 

The country faces significant challenges, including addressing economic concerns and fostering a democratic ethos. The effectiveness of the interim government depends on its ability to navigate political complexities and engage with diverse stakeholders, including the opposition BNP and Jamaat-e-Islami.  


 Bangladesh’s relationship with India, marked by economic interdependence and security concerns, is being closely watched as India seeks to promote stability and development in its neighbor.

### [Lesson from coaching centre tragedy: Don’t break the dreams of students](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/lesson-coaching-centre-tragedy-break-dreams-students-9500329/)

The coaching industry in India has grown into a dominant force, pressuring students to achieve success through standardized tests and narrow career paths. This has led to a focus on rote learning and competition, neglecting the joy of learning and the development of well-rounded individuals. 

The author argues that this system is detrimental, leading to mental exhaustion, anxiety, and a decline in creativity and critical thinking. They propose three steps to address this issue:  redefine the purpose of education to prioritize life skills and compassion, encourage critical thinking and activism against the decline of public education, and restore the meaning of studentship as a lifelong journey of learning and exploration.

While India's constitutional changes regarding Kashmir have diminished its international salience, the issue remains significant in the bilateral relationship with Pakistan. 

The international focus on Kashmir has lessened due to India's economic growth, stronger partnerships with the West and the Islamic world, and Pakistan's internal political divisions. However,  Pakistan continues to back cross-border terrorism and opposes the constitutional changes, hindering formal engagement between the two nations. Although civilian leaders in Pakistan have shown interest in dialogue, the military's influence remains strong.  India must remain vigilant, addressing internal reconciliation in Kashmir, counterterrorism efforts, and engaging with diverse segments of Pakistani society to ensure lasting peace.

Isaac Asimov's Foundation series depicts a futuristic society facing inevitable collapse, with a scientist establishing a repository of knowledge to preserve humanity.  Similarly, modern scientists propose a "lunar biorepository" to safeguard endangered species' DNA against potential extinction from various threats.  While this reflects a sci-fi fantasy becoming reality, it risks overshadowing the crucial point that for many, Earth remains their only home.

The 2024 IOC guidelines promote inclusivity in sports, emphasizing the right of all individuals to participate regardless of gender identity. However, Algerian boxer Imane Khelif and Taiwanese athlete Lin Yu-ting have faced discrimination at the Paris Olympics, highlighting the persisting challenges related to gender identity in sports.  Historical gender tests have often been influenced by cultural biases rather than scientific objectivity.

### [From Bangladesh’s students, a message: A fighting chance](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bangladesh-protests-students-message-fighting-chance-9498611/)

Bangladesh is experiencing a significant political shift following the end of Sheikh Hasina's rule. This moment presents both opportunities and risks, requiring India to approach the situation with caution and respect for Bangladeshi agency.

While India has legitimate interests in Bangladesh's stability and security, its past support for authoritarianism should be re-evaluated. Simplifying the complex political dynamics by framing events solely through an Islamist lens risks alienating the Bangladeshi people.

Bangladesh faces two main challenges: reconciling its religious and secular identities, and establishing a truly democratic party system. Student movements, with their history of challenging authoritarianism, hold a crucial role in shaping the country's future. India should avoid interfering in Bangladesh's internal processes and instead encourage the country's path towards greater freedom and institutionalization.

Recent riots across several British towns, sparked by rumors and misinformation surrounding the stabbing of three girls in Southport, have highlighted the growing influence of far-right ideologies and online hate speech. The violence, which targeted mosques, asylum seeker housing, and other symbols of diversity, has raised serious concerns about the state of civil society and the government's ability to address the root causes of this unrest. While public figures and communities have condemned the violence and expressed solidarity with the victims, the incident has exposed deep-seated anxieties about immigration and the potential for online falsehoods to incite real-world harm. The Labour government faces the urgent challenge of tackling far-right extremism, ensuring swift justice for those responsible, and engaging in honest and constructive dialogue about immigration to counter the divisive rhetoric that fueled these events.

The draft Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2024 seeks to extend regulations from traditional television to the internet, potentially impacting online speech and creative independence.  

The bill defines "digital news broadcasters" broadly, encompassing platforms like YouTube, Twitter, and podcasts discussing current affairs. It mandates registration, adherence to a Programme Code, and pre-certification for non-news content. 

Concerns arise from the bill's potential for censorship, particularly concerning political commentators. The broad powers granted to the government, coupled with extra-territorial application, raise questions about its practicality and potential impact on global content creators.  The bill also imposes new obligations on social media intermediaries, adding to existing regulatory burdens on free speech.  Critics argue that the bill's approach is ill-suited to the decentralized nature of the internet and propose alternative mechanisms like the IT Act 2000 for addressing concerns about harmful content.  The authors advocate for thorough deliberation and stakeholder engagement before the bill is enacted, emphasizing its significant implications for the future of online expression in India.

The political landscape in Bangladesh has shifted dramatically with the resignation of Sheikh Hasina and the rise of army control. Protests triggered by economic hardship and government corruption have led to this change. 

India should acknowledge the Bangladeshi people's right to self-determination and support their expression of will. While acknowledging the positive developments in India-Bangladesh relations under Hasina's rule, it's important to allow the situation to stabilize and avoid taking sides. India should prioritize economic engagement with a future government while also maintaining a cautious and discreet approach. 

Pakistan and China might try to exploit the situation to challenge India's influence, but Delhi should focus on strengthening its ties with the Bangladeshi people based on shared interests and cultural affinities.

Sheikh Hasina's recent resignation and fleeing from Bangladesh follows a period of growing unrest and challenges to her authority. Despite her party's electoral victory, the election was marred by allegations of rigging and a boycott by opposition parties. Protests against job quotas escalated into nationwide demonstrations, met with a harsh response from the government that resulted in significant casualties. The recent turmoil highlights the limitations of Hasina's development narrative and her increasingly authoritarian methods.  Her unyielding stance on historical narratives and the suppression of dissent alienated segments of the populace, potentially paving the way for the resurgence of Islamist and pro-Pakistan sentiments. Hasina's downfall presents a challenge for India, which must now navigate the complexities of maintaining its relationship with Bangladesh while safeguarding its interests in the face of rising internal instability.

Sheikh Hasina, Bangladesh's longtime Prime Minister, resigned after 15 years in power.  Her rule, characterized by notable economic progress, was marred by alleged authoritarianism, suppression of dissent, and widespread corruption. Protests, initially sparked by student demands for quota reforms, escalated into a broader movement against her government's policies. 

The public's anger was fueled by the government's response to the protests, which included the deployment of force and the labelling of demonstrators as traitors. Hasina's departure signifies a turning point in Bangladesh's political landscape, highlighting the delicate balance between economic development and democratic values.

Recent events in Jammu have demonstrated a resurgence of Pakistan-sponsored terrorism, with militants exploiting voids created by a shift in focus to other conflicts. 

This situation echoes past patterns of infiltration and tactical strategies employed by terrorists over the years. To address this,  a unified command, leveraging intelligence and engaging the local population, is crucial.  Synergy between the Army and CAPFs is essential, alongside re-equipping and training Village Defence Guards. 

The experience of previous counter-terrorism operations, including the successful strategy of  clearing jungle areas and denying terrorists refuge,  should be revisited.  Ultimately, sustained operations and effective logistics management are key to outmaneuvering and neutralizing the threat.

The UK is experiencing riots following a knife attack in Southport that killed three children. The unrest, concentrated in England,  is fueled by discontent towards immigrants, perceived to be competing for resources like housing and jobs. Economic stagnation since 2008 has exacerbated these feelings. Previous riots in the 1970s, spurred by socio-economic disparities and racial tensions, resulted in police reforms. The UK's exit from Europe, driven by anxieties over immigration, further heightened these concerns. Islamophobia, amplified by the tragic incident's false associations to Muslims, fueled the recent unrest. While authorities promise swift action against rioters, the underlying economic issues require urgent addressing to prevent further social unrest.

The Indian stock market significantly declined, triggered by growing concerns about the US economy. While domestic flows have driven the market lately,  high valuations  in India, defying logic,  raise concerns about a deeper correction.  

Though bulls have attempted to justify the continuous upward movement, the current cycle seems driven by fear of missing out and greed rather than fundamentals.  A price-to-earnings ratio similar to levels seen before the 2007 bull market peak  is a warning sign. Even companies with mediocre growth and challenging operating environments are experiencing soaring valuations. Market segments like small and midcaps and public sector companies exhibit extreme exuberance.  


Some CEO comments highlight this disconnect, with companies stating concerns about GDP correlation and challenging demand conditions while their stocks trade at inflated PE ratios. The question is whether the market will eventually adopt a more realistic view of valuations and growth prospects or if the bull run will continue.

Five years after the abrogation of Article 370, Jammu and Kashmir has seen improvements in economic development, governance, and tourism.  While security remains a concern with increasing infiltration in the Jammu sector and Pakistan's continued involvement in sponsoring terrorism, the region has experienced a record voter turnout in the recent elections.

The Jammu and Kashmir Budget 2024-25 reveals a concerning economic picture five years after the abrogation of Article 370. Despite increased borrowing, public investment has declined sharply. Tax incidence and efficiency have also decreased, while the unemployment rate remains high. The abrogation, while ending the previous political discourse on Kashmir, has failed to deliver on promises of peace and prosperity.  Social media celebration of its revocation masks the underlying anxiety and disillusionment in Kashmir. Valley-centric political parties find themselves struggling to articulate a meaningful alternative, as the reality of a redefined role for the government sets in.


While restoring statehood enjoys national support, it is insufficient to address the complex socio-economic challenges facing Kashmir. The political leadership needs to engage in a transformative process, re-evaluating their ideology and re-positioning themselves to represent the plural, progressive aspirations of the people. This is the time for Kashmir to play a crucial role in shaping a more inclusive national narrative.

The Supreme Court recently permitted the sub-classification of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes for reservation purposes. This decision allows states to differentiate within these categories to fine-tune affirmative action policies. The court emphasized the importance of empirical evidence and a clear rationale for sub-classification, subject to judicial review. 

While the ruling aims to address disparities within SC/ST communities, concerns have been raised about potential constitutional violations, political manipulation, and increased competition among marginalized groups. To ensure fair implementation, a comprehensive caste census is crucial.

This article explores the contrasting journeys of Kamala Harris and Usha Vance, two prominent Indian women in the US political landscape. Both exemplify the immigrant experience, leveraging their traditional Indian values and educational achievements to attain success. The author contrasts their rise in a society that encourages individuality and opportunity with the perceived limitations and societal pressures faced by similarly qualified Indians in their home country.  

The article argues that cultural norms and systemic issues in India stifle innovation and ambition, leading to a culture of mediocrity. It laments that while women like Harris and Vance thrive in a welcoming environment that values diversity, Indian society often discourages risk-taking and personal fulfillment.  Ultimately, the author suggests that India needs to foster a more inclusive and empowering environment to encourage its citizens to reach their full potential.

### [What is a ‘privileged Dalit’? Creamy Layer definition cannot just be economic](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/dalit-privileged-sc-st-quota-creamy-layer-economic-reservation-9494228/)

A recent Supreme Court judgement on sub-classification within SC and ST groups for reservation raises questions about its necessity and implementation. 

The author shares a personal experience of caste-based discrimination despite financial security, highlighting the persistence of social inequalities. While acknowledging the need to revisit reservations in light of changing social dynamics, the author questions how to objectively define who is most marginalised and fears that the reform could be exploited for political gain. The author emphasizes that economic progress alone does not eradicate the social disadvantages faced by Dalits, and a comprehensive caste survey is necessary to effectively address this issue.  Ultimately, the author argues that reservation, envisioned as a tool for achieving social equity and dismantling caste-based discrimination, must be preserved to ensure the continued upliftment of marginalized communities.

### [International Conference of Agricultural Economists: A chance to cement India-Africa partnership in food security](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/international-conference-agricultural-economists-india-africa-partnership-food-security-9494053/)

The 32nd International Conference of Agricultural Economists (ICAE) is being held in Delhi, India, marking the country's second time hosting this global event. ICAE, with roots tracing back to Rabindranath Tagore and Lord L K Elmhirst's vision in 1921, focuses on global food and nutritional security.  

A unique study presented at ICAE compares the agricultural practices and outcomes of 20 Indian states with 15 African countries, highlighting key areas for improvement.  Both regions face challenges such as underfunding of agricultural research and development, and low agricultural spending relative to social protection. 

The study recommends prioritizing investments in agricultural R&D and extension, reforming subsidies, and allocating resources to infrastructure development to boost agricultural growth and enhance child nutrition. 

The conference emphasizes the need for South-South collaboration, particularly between India and Africa, to address pressing food and nutritional security challenges, learning from each other's experiences and working together to build resilient food systems.
