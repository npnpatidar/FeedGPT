### [Why social media reels glorifying ‘stay-at-home’ moms are a dangerous scam](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/social-media-reels-glorifying-stay-at-home-moms-dangerous-scam-9013102/)

The article discusses the issue of glorifying stay-at-home moms (SAHMs) on social media and highlights four specific reasons why this trend is problematic. The author argues that these posts perpetuate mom guilt, shame employed mothers, overlook the realities of being a SAHM, and create divisions among mothers. The article calls for more meaningful conversations about motherhood, including the need for men to take equal responsibility for parenting. The author concludes by stating that no Instagram filter can hide the underlying issues with these posts.

### [Mohammed Shami: Pacer with a big heart](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/mohammed-shami-pacer-with-a-big-heart-9012455/)

Mohammed Shami, India's premier pacer, has displayed his exceptional skills in ODIs and T20s, mirroring his performance in Tests. He consistently hits the seam at good speed, moves the ball in both directions, and challenges both edges of the bat. Shami's classical form of pace bowling transcends different formats of the game, making him a well-rounded bowler. At 33, this farmer-turned-bowler from Amroha has become a hall of famer.

During the ongoing World Cup, Shami, along with Jasprit Bumrah and Mohammad Siraj, have stood out in India's impressive campaign. Shami particularly made a mark by becoming India's highest wicket-taker in the tournament, dismantling the Sri Lankan batsmen at the Wankhede Stadium.

Shami's journey to success has not been easy. Hailing from Uttar Pradesh, he had to relocate to West Bengal in search of an opportunity. It was after consistent performances in domestic matches that he eventually made it to the Indian team. However, his white-ball skills were doubted by selectors at one point. Despite facing abuse of a communal nature after a poor performance against Pakistan, Shami found support from then-captain Virat Kohli.

Even in this World Cup, Shami initially wasn't the first pick in the playing eleven. However, an injury to Hardik Pandya paved the way for him. Similar to his trademark in-cutters that find the gap between bat and pad, the small opportunity was enough for Shami to showcase his talent.

While batsmen and spinners have traditionally received more recognition, the pace-bowling trio of Shami, Bumrah, and Siraj have been instrumental in India's success. With seven wins in seven matches, India has secured a spot in the semifinals, largely driven by this exceptional fast-bowling attack, with Shami leading the way.

### [Developed countries will keep interest rates high](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/developed-countries-will-keep-interest-rates-high-9012454/)

Central banks in developed countries, including the European Central Bank, the US Federal Reserve, and the Bank of England, have recently chosen to maintain their interest rates at the current levels. This decision reflects the expectation that inflation is likely to remain above target for some time, leading to higher interest rates in the long term. 

The US economy has experienced strong momentum, with GDP growing at a seasonally adjusted rate of 4.9% in the third quarter, exceeding expectations. The labor market remains tight, and non-farm payrolls in September surpassed expectations. Consumer spending has also been healthy. However, while inflation has fallen, it remains well above the Federal Reserve's target of 2%, with core inflation at 3.7% on an annual basis.

In contrast, the Bank of England has adopted a more pessimistic outlook on the UK economy. It expects growth to be flat in the third quarter and only projects a growth of 0.1% for the fourth quarter. Over the medium term, growth is anticipated to remain below historical averages. Inflation in the UK stands at 6.7% and is expected to decrease to 4.5% in the first quarter of 2024 and 3.1% in the last quarter of 2024, reaching the target rate by the end of 2025.

The situation in the euro zone is similar, with the European Central Bank projecting inflation at 5.6% this year, gradually declining to 3.2% next year. Inflation is expected to approach the 2% target by 2025. Economic growth in the euro zone is expected to be modest, with a projected rate of 0.7% this year and a slight increase to 1% in 2024.

The tighter monetary policies implemented by these developed economies will have repercussions for emerging markets like India. It will impact capital flows, currency values, and exports. Given the current economic and geopolitical uncertainties, policymakers in India should prioritize ensuring macroeconomic stability.

### [Developed countries will keep interest rates high](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/developed-countries-will-keep-interest-rates-high-9012454/)

Central banks in the developed world, including the European Central Bank, the US Federal Reserve, and the Bank of England, have chosen to keep interest rates unchanged in recent meetings. This suggests that interest rates are likely to remain higher for longer due to expectations of inflation remaining above target. The US economy has shown strong momentum, with GDP growth surpassing expectations and a tight labor market. Consumer spending has also been healthy, although inflation remains above the Fed's target. In contrast, the Bank of England is pessimistic about the UK economy, projecting weak growth and entrenched inflation. The Euro Zone also expects subdued growth and inflation, with the European Central Bank projecting inflation to decline and eventually reach the 2% target by 2025. The tighter monetary policy in these economies will have consequences for emerging markets like India, affecting capital flows, currency, and exports. Policymakers in India should prioritize macroeconomic stability during this uncertain period.

### [AP’s failure to clean Delhi’s air is unfortunate](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/delhi-air-quality-air-pollution-aqi-9012445/)

The Delhi government has implemented a graded action plan in response to severe air pollution levels in the city. Measures include closing primary schools, banning construction activity, and reinforcing public transport. However, the government lacks control over the city's air quality, with unfavorable weather conditions predicted to persist for another three days. The environment minister has blamed polluted air from neighboring states for Delhi's pollution, but data shows that stubble burning in Punjab is a major contributor. Studies have linked pollution to public health issues, with estimates suggesting that pollution reduces the average Indian's life expectancy by more than five years. Despite a focus on people's welfare, the connection between pollution and health has not been adequately addressed by the Delhi and Punjab governments.

### [AAP’s failure to clean Delhi’s air is unfortunate](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/delhi-air-quality-air-pollution-aqi-9012445/)

The Delhi government has implemented the Graded Action Plan to address the city's air pollution, but it appears to be struggling to control the situation. The government has closed primary schools, banned construction activity, and reinforced public transport, but the air quality remains a concern. The IMD has forecasted unfavorable weather conditions for the next three days, and medical experts have raised public health concerns. The environment minister has blamed pollution from neighboring states for Delhi's air quality issues. There is a need for coordination between Delhi and neighboring states to address the region's air pollution. Despite efforts to reduce stubble burning in Haryana, Punjab's farm fires continue to contribute to Delhi's pollution. Studies have shown the link between pollution and public health, with India losing millions of people to diseases caused by inhaling hazardous amounts of PM 2.5. The AAP government in Delhi and Punjab prioritizes people's welfare, but they have yet to effectively address the pollution-health connection.

### [Novermber 4, Forty Years Ago: Bonus For Staff](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/novermber-4-forty-years-ago-bonus-for-staff-9012431/)

The Union Cabinet has decided to pay a 15-day ad hoc bonus to all employees with a monthly income below Rs 1,600, despite budget constraints. This measure is estimated to cost Rs 44 crore. In Lebanon, there has been a major attack by anti-Arafat Palestinians on his military positions near the Palestinian refugee camps in northern Lebanon. The attack has resulted in 34 deaths and over 119 injuries, with oil storage tanks being hit by shells. The conference of chief ministers in India could not come to a consensus on replacing sales tax with additional excise duties. The proposal has been put aside, and a resolution has called for further efforts to address the concerns expressed by state governments. In South Africa, white voters have overwhelmingly approved a new constitution that grants some non-whites a share of power for the first time. This is seen as a significant political victory for Prime Minister P.W. Botha.

The article highlights the dire situation in Gaza, describing it as a place with no safe haven and nowhere to bury the dead. The Gaza Strip has been under a blockade by Israel for 17 years, effectively cutting it off from the outside world. The people of Gaza live in a small strip of land and are unable to leave. The article describes the challenges they face in trying to flee their homes during times of conflict, such as lack of resources, destruction of infrastructure, and the risks they face from airstrikes. The article also mentions the lack of access for international journalists, making it difficult to obtain accurate information about the situation. The author notes that while there is a direction for those who are still alive to go, which is towards the border with Egypt, it is not a safe zone or a solution to their problems. The article also discusses the plight of Israeli hostages taken by Hamas and the lack of help they receive from the government. It highlights the civilian casualties in the conflict and criticizes the lack of attention given to them by politicians. Overall, the article paints a bleak picture of the situation in Gaza and emphasizes the suffering of the people caught in the conflict.

### [In Mumbai, clearing the dust, lifting the haze](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/in-mumbai-clearing-the-dust-lifting-the-haze-9011135/)

The air quality in Mumbai, India's financial capital, has worsened in recent weeks due to weather conditions and emissions from various sources. Dust emissions from construction activities have been identified as a major contributor to the deterioration. The construction sector has seen a significant increase in activity, with a rise of 68% in the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC) area since 2022 and 142% compared to 2021. The Mumbai Metropolitan Region (MMR) has also experienced a growth of 36% since 2022 and 98% since 2021. Construction processes involving activities like hammering, crushing, and excavation release dust particles that can enter human lungs. These emissions pose a threat to vulnerable populations, such as children, the elderly, and those with respiratory conditions. However, managing construction dust presents an opportunity to reduce air pollution in Mumbai. Measures such as mapping pollutant sources, creating detailed emission inventories, and establishing standard operating procedures and mitigation measures can help control emissions. Effective enforcement of guidelines and engaging all stakeholders, including builders and contractors, is crucial. Additionally, the implementation of market-ready construction technologies and equipment that reduce emissions should be promoted. Gradual implementation of these measures, with a focus on identifying solutions and building strategies in the first year, followed by stricter enforcement measures in subsequent years, can support Mumbai's transformation into a leader in mitigating air pollution while fostering economic growth.

### [Lessons in how to build an innovation ecosystem](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/lessons-in-how-to-build-an-innovation-ecosystem-9011134/)

The article discusses the importance of community involvement in successful initiatives and the role it plays in building an innovation ecosystem. It gives examples of amul, a community-based dairy cooperative society, and India's jump in the global innovation index as evidence of the impact of community-led movements. The article also talks about Atal Tinkering Labs (ATLs), which are innovation labs established in schools to cultivate young innovators. It highlights the challenge of maintaining and operating ATLs in rural areas and proposes the idea of building cooperatives of ATLs to ensure their efficiency and effectiveness. The article mentions the ATL Sarthi experiment implemented by Karnataka, Andhra Pradesh, and Jammu and Kashmir, which involves creating clusters of ATLs overseen by a guidance committee. The results show that schools in these clusters demonstrate high attendance and improved performance. However, implementing ATL Sarthi requires a mindset shift and community participation to truly unlock the potential of government initiatives.

A recent study by UCLA researchers claims to have decoded the facial expressions of cats. The study found that cats have 276 different facial expressions, with 45% being friendly, 37% being aggressive, and 18% being ambiguous. Interestingly, the study suggests that cats may have learned these facial cues from their human companions. It has been suggested that cats have evolved certain behaviors, such as meowing, to communicate specifically with humans. Animal behaviorists hope that these findings can be used to develop an app that will help cat owners understand their pets' subtle communication cues. Overall, cats have a reputation for being inscrutable, and this study offers some insight into their mysterious behavior.

This article discusses the recent detention of protestors in India following Hamas's terrorist attack and Israel's response. A former MP, Sheikh Abdul Rehman, was placed in "preventive detention" for organizing a solidarity meeting for the victims of violence in Gaza. The article argues that curbing the right to assembly and expression goes against India's support for the Palestinian cause, as Prime Minister Narendra Modi has expressed sympathy for Palestinians. The detentions also risk undermining India's carefully maintained foreign policy on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, which distinguishes between Hamas and the Palestinian Authority. The article highlights the complexity of the situation and the need for nuanced approaches. It further emphasizes the importance of supporting innocent victims of violence in Gaza and not using the crisis to deepen domestic political divides.

### [With healthy growth in direct tax and GST revenues, Centre’s fiscal arithmetic looks manageable](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/with-healthy-growth-in-direct-tax-and-gst-revenues-centres-fiscal-arithmetic-looks-manageable-9011130/)

In the first four months of the current financial year, the Indian government's tax revenues were low, causing concerns about its fiscal situation. However, there has been a significant increase in collections since August, particularly in direct taxes. Recent data reveals that this trend has continued, with gross tax collections growing by 15.8% in September. As a result, the government's tax revenue has grown by 16.3% in the first half of the year, exceeding the projected 10% growth in the budget. This is seen as encouraging.
Specifically, direct tax collections (including corporate and personal income tax) have continued to grow at a healthy rate, with corporate tax growing by 27% in September due to strong advance tax inflows. Overall, direct tax revenues have grown by 25% in the first six months of the year, reaching roughly half of the full-year target. Indirect tax revenue, particularly from the Goods and Services Tax (GST), has also been strong, with a 13.4% increase in September. GST collections have averaged Rs 1.66 lakh crore per month from April to October 2023, up 11.4% from the same period in 2022. This sustained growth in tax collections indicates economic momentum and a crackdown on tax evasion. However, excise collections are still below last year's levels.
On the non-tax side, the government's transfer from the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will provide some cushion, as it exceeded the budgeted amount. However, proceeds from disinvestment have been lower than expected, only reaching Rs 8,000 crore out of the targeted Rs 61,000 crore. On the positive side, tax devolution to states has increased by 21% compared to last year, with Rs 4.55 lakh crore transferred until September. To meet the budget target, the government needs to devolve Rs 5.66 lakh crore, similar to last year.
Regarding expenditure, total central government spending has increased by 16% in the first half of the year. Capital expenditure has grown by 29% in September and by 43% in the first six months, reaching almost half of the full-year target. While expenditure on the National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREGA) may exceed the budget allocation and proceeds from disinvestment could fall short of expectations, higher tax and non-tax collections can offer some cushion. Overall, the Indian government's fiscal arithmetic appears manageable based on these trends.

Several chief ministers expressed reservations about the proposals to replace sales tax with additional excise duty and impose a tax on inter-state consignments of goods. Non-Congress chief ministers opposed the proposals while states under Congress governments offered qualified support. Additionally, US marines invaded the island of Carriacou to recover weapons but found no Cubans. No shots were fired during the operation. India and West Germany exchanged notes, stipulating West German agreement to supply spare parts for the Tarapur atomic power plant. Furthermore, a bank was looted in Punjab and two hand grenades were found near the shop of a retired police officer.

The author disagrees with Infosys founder Narayana Murthy's appeal for younger employees to work 70 hours a week. They argue that Murthy's focus on productivity and economic prosperity overlooks the importance of distributive justice and the spirit of sharing in society. The author also criticizes the idea that hard work is the sole reason for wealth, pointing out the structural violence and inequality that exist. They urge Murthy to consider the concept of alienation in the workplace and the negative effects it can have on mental health and well-being. Finally, the author emphasizes the need to prioritize a meaningful and fulfilling life over the pursuit of economic success. They argue that there is more to life than work and consumption, and that idleness can be beautiful and allow for self-reflection and appreciation of simple pleasures.

The article discusses the changing dynamics of tax treaties and the interpretive challenges they present. It highlights India's treaties with France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, which allowed for the extension of lower tax rates to other OECD members. However, with the accession of new countries to the OECD, the issue of whether the import of tax treatment from another treaty could be given automatic effect arose.

France, the Netherlands, and Switzerland issued decrees to give effect to lower rates retrospectively from the date when Colombia, Lithuania, and Slovenia acceded to the OECD. The Delhi High Court ruled that the beneficial terms of the treaty could be extended without notification, leading taxpayers to seek a certificate for low tax deduction at source. The Central Board of Direct Taxation (CBDT) issued a circular clarifying its position, but disputes still ensued.

The article also discusses the concept of most favored nation (MFN) provisions and the need for clarity on the tax treatment of dividends. The Supreme Court's ruling that a notification is mandatory to invoke MFN reverses the tax positions for investors. The article suggests that there is a need for periodic review of tax treaties and the enforcement of anti-abuse measures.

The Bombay High Court has taken action on Mumbai's recurring pollution problem by seeking responses from local authorities. This intervention follows a series of reports highlighting the failures of local governance in addressing the crisis. Judicial involvement has been effective in driving action on pollution in other parts of India, such as Delhi, where the Supreme Court has pushed for pollution control measures. The recourse to the judiciary reflects the tendency to only address pollution as an emergency, rather than tackling the underlying causes. It is crucial for the judiciary to continue pushing state governments and authorities to take action, as recent reports have linked poor air quality to public health issues. The Mumbai High Court should ensure that the city does not experience a repeat of last year's winter, when air quality was consistently poor.

Several opposition party leaders in India have reported receiving a message from Apple warning them of potential state-sponsored attackers trying to compromise their iPhones. These leaders have accused the government of surveillance, a claim that the Information Technology Minister has denied. This is not the first time such allegations have been made, as a global investigation in 2021 revealed that the Pegasus spyware had targeted over 300 mobile phone numbers in India, including those of opposition politicians, journalists, and civil society members. The Supreme Court noted in August 2022 that the committee investigating the issue found no conclusive evidence of Pegasus spyware on the examined phones, but also criticized the lack of cooperation from the central government. Apple's threat notification feature has been active since 2021 and has been used to send warnings to individuals in around 150 countries. The company does not disclose the specific triggers for these warnings but emphasizes that state-sponsored attackers are well-funded and sophisticated. The IT minister has stated that the matter will be investigated by CERT-In. These allegations come at a time when elections are approaching in several states and the general elections are scheduled for next year. The politicians who received the Apple warning span various opposition parties. It is important for the investigation to address all doubts and be conducted in a fair, independent, and transparent manner to protect privacy, address security concerns, and uphold Indian democracy.

President Zia-ul-Haq of Pakistan stated that current difficulties caused by Indian interference in its internal affairs will not hinder the ongoing process of normalizing relations between the two countries. He believes that Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was misled by those portraying a false image of a collapsing military regime. India and China have agreed to explore ways to increase trade and bilateral exchanges in various fields. Despite recent growth in Sino-Indian trade, both governments consider the annual trade volume to be relatively low. Prices of sweets, firecrackers, candles, and dry fruits have increased by 10 to 30 percent this Diwali. The highest increase is seen in the price of dry fruits and nuts. Prime Minister Indira Gandhi called on the opposition to assist the government in solving internal problems, emphasizing the importance of unity and integrity in the country.

The article discusses Infosys founder Narayana Murthy's proposal for longer work hours for India's youth in order to improve the country's work productivity. While the idea of instilling a sense of ownership and commitment to one's country is commendable, there are challenges that need to be addressed. The article highlights the lack of shared destiny and equal opportunities in India, with the top 10% dominating popular culture and socioeconomic mobility being limited. The report also notes a high unemployment rate among young graduates, as well as the nature of gig economy jobs which hinder personal growth and advancement. Additionally, the article points out the inequality in wealth distribution, with the rich benefiting disproportionately from economic growth. The responsibility for nation-building should not solely rest on the youth, but also on those with power and privilege. To truly contribute to the progress of the nation, it is essential to empower and provide opportunities for the younger generation. Citizenship and nation-building should be based on more than just economic productivity, but should also involve learning about the country, developing empathy, and actively engaging in the community. The article calls for a cultural shift towards discipline and a stronger sense of responsibility from corporate India to move the country forward and create a sense of national purpose.

The summit's agenda includes discussing the risks and benefits of AI, establishing standards for AI safety and security, protecting privacy, advancing equity and civil rights, promoting innovation and competition, and more. While the focus is on safety, there are differing opinions on regulation and promotion, as well as defining "frontier AI." The summit may lay out important markers for the global discourse on AI regulation. India, as a contributor to the global development of AI, will also need to find its own voice on AI governance.

Percy Abeysekara, also known as Uncle Percy, passed away at the age of 87. He was Sri Lanka's most famous cricket cheerleader and was even more popular than Pakistan's Chacha Cricket.

### [UN report on groundwater extraction: Every drop counts](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/un-report-on-groundwater-extraction-every-drop-counts-9008120/)

A recent report by United Nations University warns that 27 out of 31 aquifers in India are depleting faster than they can be replenished. This issue has been a cause for concern for over a decade, with various reports highlighting the poor state of the country's aquifers. In response, the Union Jal Shakti Ministry initiated the Atal Bhujal Yojana in 78 water-stressed districts, which aims to bring about behavioral changes at the community level. While this program has shown some positive results, more action is needed from the government to address the severity of the crisis. India currently pumps up the most groundwater globally, and about 70% of the country's water usage comes from groundwater sources. The use of tubewells and borewells has played a significant role in ensuring food security, but there has been little emphasis on institutional innovations in the water sector. The link between power subsidies and the falling water table in states like Punjab is evident, and demand-side management remains a complex problem. Researchers have also connected groundwater extraction to the climate crisis, particularly in the southwest region where hard rock aquifers already limit recharging. The promotion of less water-intensive crops and efficient watering techniques has been attempted, but the gravity of the crisis often goes unnoticed until it's too late. The use of technologies that allow people to monitor the water available in their borewells could be a catalyst for behavioral changes and responsible aquifer management.

### [Ram temple inauguration and consolidation of the BJP vote bank](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ram-temple-inauguration-and-consolidation-of-the-bjp-vote-bank-9008117/)

The inauguration of the Ram Janmabhoomi temple in India on January 22, 2024, is expected to have a significant impact on politics and society. The ruling party and government will likely use the temple as a symbol and message during the upcoming parliamentary elections. The event is part of a series of actions over the past three decades that have created a political consciousness and mobilized the majority Hindu community. The temple's inauguration may also promote an inclusive narrative through religious symbolism, benefiting the BJP politically. Opposition parties may need to negotiate this rejuvenation of Hindutva identity and may consider adopting a "soft Hindutva" narrative. The temple's inauguration could weaken caste-based politics and lead to a stronger Hindu voting bloc. Overall, the event is expected to boost the BJP's political standing and increase Prime Minister Narendra Modi's influence.

Finance Minister Pranab Mukherjee expressed concern over the price situation, noting that the seasonal decline was weak and inflation had crossed double-digit figures in October. However, he expected prices to decline from November and stated that the budgetary situation was comfortable. The Akalis and the government in Punjab have hardened their attitudes, with no indication of any softening for at least two weeks. The moderate Akalis, who had planned a campaign for communal harmony, feel demoralized. The death toll in the Turkish earthquake has reached almost 1000, with over 25,000 people homeless and 40 mountain villages still cut off. Rescue workers fear more people may be buried in the rubble. India is set to receive the first batch of Mirage 2000 aircraft by September next year, with all 40 aircraft expected to be delivered by the end of 1986.

### [On Maratha agitation, expanding economic pie is key — not reservation](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/on-maratha-agitation-expanding-economic-pie-is-key-not-reservation-9008111/)

The article discusses the resurgence of the Maratha community's agitation for reservation in Maharashtra and the violent turn it has taken. The attacks on legislators' homes and the vandalizing of public property by protesters have hindered dialogue and turned the issue into a law and order problem. The hunger strike by Maratha Kranti Morcha leader Manoj Jarange Patil adds urgency to finding a resolution, but the article suggests that such brinksmanship is not conducive to a lasting solution. The Maharashtra government has previously attempted to provide reservation for the Maratha community but faced legal challenges. The Supreme Court struck down the 2018 Maharashtra State Reservation for Socially and Educationally Backward Classes Act, stating that the Marathas are not socially and educationally backward. The article highlights that dominant communities in various states are demanding reservation, despite their political influence and economic power not translating into income and educational capital for all individuals within these communities. The article argues that addressing the lack of representation and backwardness at the community level requires looking beyond quotas and focusing on expanding the economic and education opportunities for all Indians. Skill development and policy interventions by the state can help uplift communities without relying solely on quotas. However, this requires a shift from brinksmanship to a genuine dialogue.

### [What makes ‘Kaala Paani’ such a compelling watch](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/what-makes-kaala-paani-such-a-compelling-watch-9007657/)

The article discusses the Netflix series "Kaala Paani" and how it reflects the uncertainties and fears brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Set in the year 2027 on the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, the series portrays a world that has already battled COVID-19 and is now facing a similar waterborne disease called LHF-27. The series captures the feeling of uncertainty and the everyday presence of death that the pandemic has left behind.

The article highlights how the series remembers the dominant feeling of uncertainty and the transient nature of life that the pandemic has brought. Characters in the series, including those who are doing good and seem deserving of a full life, are cut short, emphasizing the randomness and illogicality of death. The survival of characters is not based on their responsibility but on luck and privilege, highlighting the theme of survival of the fittest.

The series also tackles themes of unequal power struggles and the impact of capitalist greed on society. The Orakas, a fictional tribal group, are the only ones who understand how to live in harmony with the natural world and are safe from the virus. However, their existence is precarious in a society driven by capitalist greed.

The article suggests that the series raises questions about what it means to be human and live in a world where things seem out of control. Each character offers different answers to this question, and the series challenges the notion that taking care only of our own interests is the correct answer. It emphasizes the importance of small acts of care and hope in the face of uncertainty.

The article concludes by drawing a parallel between the series and the current situation in Palestine, where people are facing unimaginable cruelty and violence. Despite the absence of a virus to blame, people in Palestine continue to show care for one another, offering a glimmer of hope in difficult times.

Overall, the article highlights the relevance of "Kaala Paani" in reflecting the uncertainties and fears of the post-COVID world and the importance of care and hope in such times.

A severe earthquake in eastern Turkey has resulted in the death of at least 500 people, with hundreds more injured and over 50 villages destroyed. The final death toll is estimated to exceed 1,000. The earthquake, measuring at least six on the Richter scale, struck Erzurum province, the second largest town in eastern Turkey. In other news, the Indian middle-order batting struggled against the West Indies, only managing to score 165 runs from 44.1 overs.

Akali Dal Chief Harchand Singh Longowal rejected Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's offer to refer the territorial dispute, including Chandigarh, Abohar, and Fazilka, to a tribunal for settlement. Longowal asserted that Chandigarh belongs to Punjab and that Punjab's claim on Abohar and Fazilka is unquestionable.

### [The household debt challenge](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-household-debt-challenge-9006522/)

Household debt in India has surged to 5.8% of the GDP in FY23, the second-highest annual increase since independence. However, there is little discussion about the sustainability of this rise. To assess the sustainability of debt, the debt service ratio (DSR) is commonly used, which measures the proportion of income used to repay debt-related obligations. India's household DSR has been consistently increasing over the past two decades and is higher than most advanced economies, reaching approximately 12% in FY23. This is attributed to higher interest rates and shorter debt tenure. However, improvements have been seen in borrowing terms, with longer maturity periods and falling interest rates. Compared to other countries, India's household DSR is similar to heavily indebted Nordic countries but higher than China, France, the UK, and the US. The sustainable level of household debt in India is estimated to be around 60%, and at the current pace of growth, Indian households may reach this threshold within the next five to six years. Increasing the residual maturity profile of borrowers and reducing the effective interest rate could help raise the threshold of household leverage. The Reserve Bank of India has drawn attention to the escalating household debt and cautioned lenders, highlighting the need for collaboration between regulators and lenders to distribute the impact of growth over time.

Mario Vargas Llosa, the Nobel-Prize-winning Peruvian writer, has announced that his latest novel, "Le dedico mi silencio," will be his last. At 87 years old, he plans to focus on shorter pieces, including an essay on his teacher, Jean-Paul Sartre. Throughout his literary career, Llosa has been known for his originality and larger-than-life personality. He was one of the architects of the Latin American Boom in the 1960s and '70s, along with Gabriel Garcia Marquez, Carlos Fuentes, and Julio Cortázar. Llosa's novels have explored themes of power, corruption, and the erosion of liberal values by authoritarian regimes. Interestingly, Llosa's own political engagement has shifted from radical left to centrist right over the years. He attributes this to practicality and the ability to adapt to the current moment.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) has taken action against financial influencers who provide misleading information and influence clients to deal in securities. Mohammad Nasiruddin Ansari has been barred from the securities market and ordered to pay back Rs 17.2 crore. Another influencer, P R Sundar, settled a case with SEBI and agreed to refrain from buying/selling securities for a year, paying a settlement amount and disgorgement of over Rs 6 crore. These actions reflect SEBI's determination to regulate unregistered investment advisors and tighten norms for financial influencers. The rise of financial influencers has brought issues such as self-styled experts with little market knowledge, exaggerated claims for attention, and unethical practices. Novice investors have suffered as a result, and concerns have been raised about the incentive structures and relationships of these influencers. SEBI has highlighted these concerns and aims to restrict the association of registered intermediaries with unregistered finfluencers. However, influencers can also play a role in financial education and advice for those unfamiliar with the markets. As the economy grows and more individuals invest in stocks, ensuring accurate financial information, educating investors, and protecting them will be crucial.

The Supreme Court has dismissed the bail plea of senior AAP leader Manish Sisodia, prompting the party to express disagreement with the decision. Delhi Minister Atishi stated that the party will explore all legal options before deciding on its next course of action. Atishi emphasized that the AAP is an honest party and that the Delhi government has not been involved in any corruption cases. The AAP's legal team will review the Supreme Court order before taking any further steps. During the bail plea hearing, the court questioned the prosecution about the "money trail" related to Sisodia and whether he or his family members had received any money. Atishi expressed confidence that no corruption cases will be proven against the AAP. BJP MP Manoj Tiwari reacted to the decision by stating that the Supreme Court has established a money trail in the excise policy scam. Sisodia was arrested in February for alleged corruption in the New Liquor Policy 2021-22 and was later arrested by the Enforcement Directorate in the same case.

### [India’s vote on UN resolution marks a new realism in Middle East policy](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/india-vote-un-resolution-new-realism-middle-east-policy-9004868/)

India's recent vote at the United Nations General Assembly on the war in Gaza marks a shift in its approach to the Middle East. India abstained from the Arab resolution calling for a humanitarian truce in Gaza and supported a failed Canadian amendment condemning the Hamas attack on Israel. This shift is not about India abandoning the Palestine cause, but rather about adopting a policy rooted in a hard-headed assessment of the shifting regional dynamic and India's enduring interests, especially in relation to terrorism. In the past, India routinely voted with the Arab resolutions against Israel and ignored the issue of terrorism from the Arab world. However, with its latest vote, India has emphasized its concerns on international terrorism while still advocating for a two-state solution in Palestine. While this new realism is welcome, the BJP government needs to be cautious about being accused of playing "vote bank" politics with a region that is of vital interest to India. India's real diplomatic task lies outside the UN and includes stepping up outreach to the Arab world, explaining its commitment to Palestine's statehood, pressing Israel to respect the laws of war, and providing humanitarian assistance to Gaza. The government also needs to brief Opposition leaders on its regional policy and crack down on extremist groups spreading disinformation in favor of Israel. Overall, India must ensure that its carefully crafted strategy of interest-based realism in the Middle East is not undermined by fringe groups.

The article discusses the Indian government's plan to use senior bureaucrats to showcase its achievements and reach out to beneficiaries of welfare schemes. However, the Election Commission has intervened and directed the government not to carry out this program in the five election-bound states. The article highlights how this incident reflects the government's tendency to involve bureaucrats in party-political programs and centralize power. It also mentions the BJP's role in redefining welfare by prioritizing the provision of specific benefits to individuals, rather than focusing on public goods and existing safety nets. Despite the Election Commission's intervention, the article concludes that the government's approach to welfare politics continues to roll on.

The article concludes by emphasizing the fictional nature of the show and how it offered viewers a sense of connection and companionship.

The Allahabad High Court recently rejected a plea for protection by an interfaith couple, stating that live-in relationships are temporary and fragile. The court emphasized that unless the couple decides to marry, the court does not express an opinion. This reflects the negative perception of romantic partnerships outside of marriage in Indian society, despite Supreme Court rulings that validate live-in relationships. However, cohabitation before marriage can help individuals make informed choices and reduce the rate of divorce, as seen in the West. In India, those who choose to cohabit are often viewed as frivolous and face difficulties finding housing. The article highlights the contradictions and unrealistic expectations surrounding love and marriage, leading to rising divorce rates. It suggests that trying out coupled life before committing to marriage can be beneficial, as rationality plays a role in mate selection.

The article discusses the recent advice given by Narayana Murthy, the founder of Infosys, to young IT professionals in India. Murthy suggests that they should work 70 hours a week to address low productivity concerns and meet global demands. However, the article argues that a workforce struggling with high stress, low income, and poor work-life balance is not a solid foundation for nation building. It highlights that South and East Asia have the highest average weekly work hours, while developed nations like Belgium, France, and Germany are experimenting with shorter hours. In Asian countries, including India, flexi-time and work-life balance are seen as signs of lower commitment and competence. This mentality disproportionately affects women, as a 24/7 work culture assumes a supervisory infrastructure to take care of other aspects of an employee's life, which is often not available to women. The article emphasizes the need for more balanced and mutually equitable ways of working, with practical expectations and support mechanisms for both men and women. It concludes by stating that work should not solely focus on future accomplishments but also consider the lives, relationships, and dreams of individuals.

### [Valmiki’s Ramayana gave Dalits space to reclaim their identity](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/valmikis-ramayana-gave-dalits-space-to-reclaim-their-identity-9003302/)

This article discusses the significance of the Ramayana and its impact on Indian society and politics. It highlights the temple dedicated to Valmiki, the author of the Ramayana, in Delhi, which has historical importance as Mahatma Gandhi resided there and Prime Minister Narendra Modi initiated the Swachh Bharat Mission. The Ramayana is not only a literary masterpiece, but it also addresses questions of morality, ethics, and the consequences of unregulated emotions. The concept of "Ram Rajya" symbolizing an ideal state has influenced the current government and is integrated into political and cultural discourse. The article also emphasizes how the Ramayana has empowered marginalized communities, particularly the Dalits, who have reclaimed their identity through the worship of Valmiki. The celebration of Valmiki Jayanti and the preservation of his work contribute to the cause of social justice. The article concludes by acknowledging that caste discrimination still persists in modern India, highlighting the importance of Valmiki's teachings in reclaiming identity and fostering a harmonious collective identity.

### [On ‘rath prabharis’, EC does the right thing — Centre should take notes](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/ec-does-right-9002627/)

The Election Commission has directed the cabinet secretary to prevent the "Viksit Bharat Sankalp Yatra" from making stops in the five poll-bound states. This comes after controversy arose when ministries planned to nominate senior bureaucrats as "rath prabharis" for the yatra, which aims to showcase the government's achievements. The Opposition accused the government of politicizing the bureaucracy. The EC cited the Model Code of Conduct, which is in effect until December 5, as the reason for its decision. The government has also changed the nomenclature for those in charge of the yatra to "nodal officers" instead of "rath prabharis." However, as crucial elections approach, it is clear that the work of checking and balancing is not yet complete. The Enforcement Directorate has recently taken action against members of the Opposition, such as raiding the homes of Rajasthan Congress president Govind Singh Dotasra and issuing summons to Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot's son. This pattern of targeting the Opposition ahead of elections raises concerns about a skewed playing field.

### [Attacking Congress for respecting rights of Palestinians is in poor taste](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/amid-crisis-fear-mongering-9002613/)

The article by Yeshaya Rosenman, published in this newspaper, criticizes the Indian Congress party for expressing support for the rights of Palestinians. The article argues that sympathizing with Palestinians could lead to jihadist violence in India and suggests that aligning with Israel's perspective is necessary to avoid this. The writer uses inflammatory language and makes sweeping statements without evidence to deepen the communal divide in India. The article equates Jews and Hindus with Hamas and Muslims, urging them to unite against all Muslims. This kind of discourse is tragically common on right-wing social media platforms in India, but it is concerning to see it given the credibility of being published in a mainstream newspaper. The writer's final statement is provocative and poorly timed, as the world needs peaceful voices and words.

### [Indians sentenced to death in Qatar: Get them from Doha to Delhi](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/indian-navy-officers-death-penalty-qatar-court-death-penalty-9002619/)

Qatar's court of first instance has sentenced eight former Indian navy officers to death, posing a challenge for Indian diplomacy. The Ministry of External Affairs has expressed concern and is awaiting the detailed judgment. The charges against the officers have not been made public, but they were arrested in August last year on undeclared charges of espionage. The case tests India's ties with Qatar, a country where over 800,000 Indians live and work. Both countries have tried to build friendly relations, with Qatar being India's most important natural gas supplier. However, there have been rough patches, including Qatar's aggressive campaign against India after the abrogation of Article 370 in 2019. Qatar's growing ambitions in West Asia, such as hosting US military installations and maintaining ties with Iran and the Taliban, complicate India's task. India should remain engaged in helping its citizens, using diplomatic channels but treading carefully due to the conflict in the region.

### [October 28, Forty Years Ago: Grenada invaded](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/october-28-forty-years-ago-grenada-invaded-9002616/)

The US Marines have captured Fort Frederick in Grenada, which is believed to be the last major objective of the US-led invasion of Barbadian island. The barracks, located northeast of the capital, St. George's, fell after heavy fighting. Although resistance was strong, the final assault on the hilltop fort was relatively easy. In other news, the Indian defense services are considering significant changes in their rank structure, departing from the existing British-inherited system. Additionally, a violent incident occurred at the Mandi, resulting in injuries to ten policemen and several civilians. Lastly, despite bomb attacks in Beirut that killed over 270 US and French soldiers, participants in the Lebanon peacekeeping force have reaffirmed their decision to keep troops in Beirut, pending reconciliation efforts and the withdrawal of all foreign forces.

### [Political misinformation is a problem. But asking WhatsApp to risk user privacy is the wrong solution](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/remedy-worse-than-malaise-9002600/)

The article discusses the issue of political misinformation and deep fakes in the context of upcoming elections. It highlights the government's plan to use Rule 4(2) of the 2021 Information Technology Intermediary Guidelines to counter deep fakes. This rule requires social media messaging entities to have the capability to identify the "first originator of the information" on their platforms. However, the article argues that this solution may be more damaging than the problem itself.

The article raises concerns about the potential misuse of this rule and its impact on privacy. It compares the demand for identifying the originator of messages to a scenario where the government wants to track every citizen's movement. The article also points out that the listed grounds for invoking this rule, such as public order, leave room for interpretation and may lead to excessive intrusion.

Furthermore, the article highlights the challenges and limitations of traceability. It argues that the concept of the "first originator" is not clearly defined, and innocent users may be affected while sophisticated miscreants can easily evade it. Additionally, maintaining logs of message origins compromises the privacy of all messaging users.

The article concludes by stating that Rule 4(2) is currently being challenged in courts and highlights a recent case where the Tripura High Court stayed an order demanding the origin of a fake resignation letter. It warns that opening the floodgates of message traceability in the name of preserving election integrity may not be an effective remedy and could have negative consequences.

### [Hasan Minhaj row: An unfair focus on the ‘who’ over the ‘what’](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/an-artistes-license-9002628/)

This article discusses the controversy surrounding Asian-American stand-up comic Hasan Minhaj and his use of selective and exaggerated versions of events in his performances. A New Yorker profile criticized Minhaj for presenting his audience with half-truths, but Minhaj defends himself by stating that his artistic choices were rooted in truth and personal experiences of racism and surveillance. The article argues that while Minhaj may need to reflect on his approach, the focus on half-truths overlooks the importance of exaggeration and irony in art as tools for truth-telling, particularly for marginalized communities. The article suggests that the attention should be on the message being conveyed rather than who is delivering it.

### [Koffee with a new, vulnerable Karan](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/koffee-with-karan-johar-9002335/)

The first episode of season eight of filmmaker Karan Johar's chat show, Koffee with Karan, takes on a quieter and more reflective tone compared to the show's previous seasons. Known for its fun and frivolous nature, the show has gained a reputation for providing an insider glimpse into the lives of celebrities. Karan Johar, a prominent figure in Bollywood, would casually chat with his guests, often discussing their personal lives and industry dynamics. However, the show took a turn when actor Kangana Ranaut sparked a conversation about nepotism, calling out Johar for working with his friends' children. The debate gained momentum after Sushant Singh Rajput's tragic death as it targeted Bollywood celebrities, including Johar, and also attacked his sexuality. Bollywood then experienced a lull in creativity, leading to criticism of Johar's mainstream aesthetic and the lack of originality in Hindi films. The previous season of Koffee with Karan received negative reviews for being dull and creepy. However, season eight seems to have brought back the gloss of the show, possibly due to the success of recent Bollywood movies. The first episode features Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh, who have been part of successful films produced by Johar. Surprisingly, the episode avoids the usual gossip and games, instead focusing on Johar's self-reflection, Padukone and Singh's wedding footage, and a vulnerable moment where Johar speaks about feeling alone. The article suggests that Johar's self-reflection may have influenced his latest directorial project, Rocky Aur Rani Ki Prem Kahani, which addresses societal expectations of masculinity and preserves the essence of Hindi films. The episode also highlights discussions on mental health, with Padukone and Johar openly sharing their struggles and initiatives to create awareness. Johar's honesty and ability to reveal himself with candor are seen as refreshing in the context of mainstream Bollywood.

The article discusses the potential overstretch in American grand strategy due to the unexpected explosion of the Israel-Palestine conflict. It questions whether the US can effectively handle simultaneous wars in Europe, the Middle East, and Asia, especially considering the growing strategic collaboration between Beijing, Moscow, and Tehran. The article highlights that Russia and China believe the West is in decline and American primacy could be challenged, but the US has demonstrated its capability to counter these challenges. It mentions the US's gains in Europe and Asia, including strengthening alliances, expanding military support for Taiwan, and raising the costs of a potential Chinese invasion. However, the recent violence in Israel and Gaza has raised concerns about the US's capacity to prevail in all three theaters. The article also discusses the fraying domestic consensus on foreign policy, with some questioning unending military support to Ukraine and Washington's uncritical support for Israel. Despite these challenges, the article argues that it would be unwise to underestimate the US's strategic resilience. It emphasizes the enduring strength of the Washington establishment in moderating extreme domestic arguments and pursuing essential US interests worldwide. Additionally, it notes that while there are concerns about US decline, its share of global GDP remains significant, and it continues to outspend other countries on defense. The article also highlights the US's diplomatic leverage in shaping regional landscapes and its advantage in having a system of alliances that surpasses those of Russia and China. It concludes by stating that while challenges exist, Washington has the will, resources, and room for geopolitical maneuvering.

### [Breaking the ice: How India can help save the Arctic](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/breaking-the-ice-how-india-can-help-save-the-arctic-9001185/)

India has surprised many by hosting the G20 Summit and achieving consensus among the Global North and Global South. This is important for protecting the Arctic, which is warming at a rate four times faster than the global average. The melting Arctic has significant implications for the climate emergency, including the release of stored carbon and triggering catastrophic climate tipping points. The impacts of Arctic change disproportionately affect the Global South, such as extreme rainfall events during the Indian summer monsoon. The Arctic Council, the current governance mechanism for the Arctic, has been suspended, making it difficult to hold countries accountable. India's involvement in the Arctic Council as a member or observer could help push for an end to further exploitation. India's ability to bridge divides between the Global North and Global South, as seen at the G20 Summit, holds potential for safeguarding global ecosystems, including the Arctic. India should use its upcoming virtual G20 Summit to raise the Arctic as part of a constructive conversation on climate governance and push for reforms to protect the climate in the Arctic.

The article discusses the practice of sending Indian parliamentary delegations to the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) and how it has been discontinued under the BJP government. The author, a member of parliament, recalls their experience speaking at the UNGA in 2012 and highlights the importance of the delegation in representing India's interests and engaging with the UN. Various parliamentarians from different political parties express their disappointment with the discontinuation of the practice, criticizing the government's centralization of power and lack of engagement with the opposition. They argue that sending parliamentary delegations to the UNGA helps showcase India's democracy and ideals on a global stage. The article concludes by lamenting the loss of this tradition and the implications it has for India's representation at the UN.

In an article about various events, it is mentioned that about 800 paratroopers from the US Army's 82nd Airborne Division arrived in Grenada to support the American invasion force fighting against Cuban and Grenadian troops on the Caribbean island. India condemned the invasion and called for the immediate withdrawal of all foreign forces from Grenada.

In another incident, Jordan's ambassador to Italy, Taysir Alaedin Toukan, was targeted in an assassination attempt where a gunman shot him seven times. The attack also wounded his Egyptian driver, Mohamed Hidar Baud. No one has claimed responsibility for the shooting yet, and both the ambassador and the driver underwent emergency operations.

Additionally, supporters of the National Democratic Alliance, led by the Bharatiya Janata Party President A.B. Vajpayee and the Lok Dal President Charan Singh, held a day-long protest at the Boat Club. They were protesting against the addition of beef and pig tallow to vanaspati. The protestors listened to speeches delivered by leaders from both parties throughout the day.

Finally, the government seems to have postponed sending an invitation to the Akalis for talks due to ongoing terrorist activities in the state. The Home Minister, P.C. Sethi, stated that no date had been set for sending the letter but assured that the government was open for talks.

Artificial intelligence (AI) poses various concerns, including the potential loss of jobs, misuse of people's identities, and the ability to plan bioweapon attacks. European bodies have called for regulation to prevent the technology from undermining democracy. However, for ordinary office workers tired of unproductive meetings, there is good news. Companies like Google and Microsoft are introducing AI assistants that can attend virtual meetings on their behalf. These AI assistants can be punctual, focused, take notes, and provide summaries. They can also enforce meeting etiquette, pointing out dominant participants or interruptions. Despite these advancements, humans will still have to endure physical meetings for now. Nevertheless, the idea of AI completely taking over meetings seems appealing to many.

### [Market volatility is unlikely to subside soon](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/market-volatility-is-unlikely-to-subside-soon-9001179/)

Indian markets continued to decline on Thursday, with the BSE Sensex dropping 900 points and the Nifty closing below the 19,000 level. This comes after several weeks of weakness, with the Sensex falling approximately 4.5% in the past month. The fear gauge, Nifty VIX, has also increased, indicating heightened market volatility. The decline in Indian markets is in line with a broader sell-off in Asian markets, with the Nikkei falling 2.14% and the Kospi dropping 2.7% on Thursday alone. The weakness in India is seen across various sectors, including automobiles and banking. Furthermore, both midcap and smallcap stocks have also come under pressure. The decline in the markets is influenced by domestic concerns, such as mixed second-quarter results and sluggish rural consumption, as well as global factors like the conflict in West Asia and the possibility of higher yields in developed economies like the US. The US 10-year bond yield has reached levels not seen since 2007 and better-than-expected US home sales data has raised questions about interest rates. These factors suggest that market volatility is unlikely to decrease in the near future.

The article discusses the need to improve accessibility to medical care, particularly in rural areas, through the Ayushman Bharat health program in India. The project aims to transform public health centers into health and wellness centers to bring healthcare closer to people's homes. However, there are chronic shortages of doctors, medical professionals, and healthcare infrastructure that need to be addressed. Many community healthcare centers and public health centers in Uttar Pradesh are not even physical structures, and the state government needs to expedite work on these centers. Private healthcare facilities are dominant in urban areas but lack a community-oriented approach and focus on preventive care. The rural medical system continues to face a shortage of doctors and infrastructure, with only 45% of public health centers functioning 24/7. There is also a shortage of nurses in several states, including Uttar Pradesh. The article emphasizes the importance of public health centers as the first point of contact between the community and medical professionals, particularly during disease outbreaks like the COVID-19 pandemic. The lack of well-equipped medical centers at the village and district levels can lead to disease escalation. The article calls for Uttar Pradesh and other states with poor healthcare indices to take immediate action to improve their healthcare systems.

The Supreme Court of India, known for its powerful influence on the country's politics and citizens' lives, has shown a surprising lack of action when it comes to the fundamental rights of the queer community. While the court recognizes the discrimination faced by the LGBTQIA community, it has refused to recognize their right to civil partnerships and adoption. Instead, the court hopes that the legislature will address these injustices. However, this deference to Parliament is both legally and morally wrong. The court has a constitutional obligation to step in and provide relief when faced with deprivations and systemic injustices. The framers of the Constitution entrusted the court with the task of defending the fundamental rights of all citizens, and the court has the power to invalidate unconstitutional laws and compel the government to act in accordance with the Constitution. To argue that the court is powerless in the face of legislative inaction is to prioritize constitutional immorality. It allows future parliaments to undermine fundamental rights by creating complex laws that grant rights to some while denying them to others. This argument also equates majoritarianism with democracy, which goes against constitutional values. The queer community needs substantive rights and immediate relief, not just platitudes and sympathy. It is hoped that wise and empathetic judges will address the marriage equality case soon.

The article discusses the issue of same-sex marriage in India. It highlights that historically, marriage has been understood as a union between a man and a woman for procreation purposes. However, same-sex relationships are now accepted in society and same-sex marriage is gaining popularity worldwide. The article mentions that only South Africa in Africa and Taiwan in Asia have legalized same-sex marriage. In India, a writ petition was filed in the Supreme Court arguing for the recognition of same-sex marriage based on fundamental rights and social considerations. However, the court ruled that the power to make laws regarding marriage lies with Parliament or state legislatures, and the court does not have the authority to declare same-sex marriage legal. The article concludes by stating that the decision on whether to accept same-sex marriage rests with the country's legislative bodies.

It highlights issues such as market concentration, skewed incentives, low information literacy, and partisan biases that affect both social media platforms and traditional media. The author mentions the shrinking budgets for content moderation work and research at social media platforms, which has led to a lack of accountability. They also discuss the changes made by Twitter, now known as "X," which have made it less useful for real-time information and research. The article raises concerns about the influence of individual personalities on news consumption and the high cost of accessing Twitter's APIs for researchers. It also mentions instances of misinformation and enforcement decisions on social media platforms, as well as the challenges of content moderation in conflict scenarios. The author emphasizes the need for greater scrutiny of technology platforms and investments in understanding information flows and addressing underlying issues.

### [There is a better way to tackle the problem of human trafficking](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/tackling-human-trafficking-police-home-ministry-9000209/)

The Delhi police recently arrested a woman accused of human trafficking, 30 years after the case was first registered against her. The case was initially reported when one of the victims lodged a complaint stating that she was abducted, raped, and sold off to multiple men by the accused and her gang members. However, the police station where the case was registered shut down, leading to a lack of access to the case records. This incident highlights the need for a structured mechanism to handle trafficking cases and the establishment of specialized units with trained personnel. Currently, there are Anti-Trafficking Units (AHTUs) in India, but many of them are not fully functional or lack resources. The Ministry of Home Affairs issued a scheme in 2011 to establish AHTUs and enhance cooperation between stakeholders such as law enforcement agencies, governments, and NGOs. However, it is important to strengthen the existing AHTU network by providing infrastructure and conducting training workshops for officials. Sensitivity and victim-friendly approaches are also crucial, especially in cases involving children. The arrest of the accused after so many years gives hope to trafficking victims and emphasizes the importance of reinforcing AHTUs and ensuring efficient implementation of the 2011 scheme.

### [Why India must offer student work visas](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-india-must-offer-student-work-visas-8999601/)

The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 aims to improve the quality of higher education in India by focusing on internationalization. The policy includes reforms such as updating syllabi, attracting foreign students and faculty, and offering joint degrees with foreign universities. Currently, there are 54,000 colleges in India serving 38.5 million students, but the quality varies. To address this, private universities have emerged, but they struggle to attract foreign students. Allowing foreign students to gain work experience in India after completing their degrees would help bridge this gap and benefit Indian companies with international aspirations. By recruiting foreign talent on Indian campuses and hiring alumni from Indian institutions who return to their home countries, Indian companies can develop a pool of overseas talent familiar with working in India. Expanding student work visas would also benefit foreign students studying in India under various scholarships. Currently, India has 49,000 foreign students, but the Ministry of Education aims to reach 200,000 by 2023-24. Concerns about foreign students taking jobs from Indian students are unfounded as India's population growth is declining and the country will soon face an aging population. Offering post-study work visas like countries such as the US, UK, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada do would help sustain economic growth. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has identified higher education as an export sector to promote overseas. Elite Indian institutions like IIMs and IITs have already expanded abroad, and private universities have established campuses in other countries. Given the current geopolitical situation and uncertainty surrounding Western education, it is crucial for India to amend its student visa regime to attract more international students. This would require notification by the Ministry of Home Affairs permitting paid employment under the "S" category visa, determination of tax laws by the Ministry of Finance, guidelines for on-campus recruitment of foreigners by the Ministry of Education through UGC and AICTE, and advocacy from Indian multinational companies for a change in the student visa.

The article discusses the dilemma of energy transition in India and the need to consider the logic and incentives of domestic energy transition. It highlights the historical waves of power plant construction in India and how the next wave is likely to be the mass construction of renewable energy assets. The article also mentions the regional consequences of this renewable energy build-out, with western and southern states benefiting the most so far. However, coal-rich states are likely to face a decline in coal royalties and an increase in power procurement costs, leading to budget deficits. The article emphasizes the need for a balanced regional developmental approach that includes RE-poor states in the energy transition through measures such as preferential lending, financial transfers, and collaborative industrial policy. Without addressing these issues, India's ambitions for an energy transition may be hindered.

The assailant, believed to be from West Asia, managed to escape. In a separate incident, a suspected extremist named Harbhajan Singh was arrested in Delhi for his involvement in a plot to assassinate the Nirankari chief Baba Hardev Singh. Police seized firearms from Singh, including a Pakistani-made .32 revolver and a .12 bore country-made pistol. In other news, approximately 2,000 US troops, along with soldiers from six Caribbean nations, invaded the Marxist-ruled country of Grenada. President Reagan confirmed that they had secured both of the island's airports, but casualty figures were still unknown. Reports suggested that a US helicopter had been shot down and three Cubans were killed with 22 wounded. Lastly, the resolution on air safety passed during the annual general meeting of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) avoided mentioning the recent shooting down of a Korean airliner due to objections from some airlines from Arab countries. Instead, the compromise resolution expressed concern over the use of force against civil aircraft in the past and present.

Tens of thousands of women and non-binary individuals in Iceland went on strike to protest the gender pay gap and gender-based violence. This strike, the first of its kind since 1975, brought the nation to a standstill for 24 hours. The strike included workers from various industries, including the fishing industry, education, healthcare, government, and even the Prime Minister. While some may view this strike as a sign that even in a country known for its social equality, women still face challenges, others see it as a symbol of hope and aspiration. The struggle for equality is not easy, but the lesson from Iceland is that the dream for equality will never die.

The withdrawal of the southwest monsoon in Mumbai has led to a spike in pollution levels for the second year in a row. The city's municipality, the Brihanmumbai Municipal Corporation (BMC), is partly to blame for the poor air quality. The BMC's Pollution Mitigation Plan identifies five sources of pollution, but its response has been slow and inadequate. The waste management system is limited to residential buildings, leaving out slum clusters where waste burning is common. This has led to a 45% increase in PM 2.5 components compared to last year. The BMC's enforcement mechanism and investment in awareness about responsible waste management are lacking. A CAG report also highlighted the BMC's poor planning and misuse of funds. The municipality's failures have resulted in public health costs, including an increase in respiratory diseases and exposure of school children to poor air quality. The BMC needs to prioritize people's well-being and take immediate action.

The upcoming assembly elections in Madhya Pradesh are expected to have a different political narrative compared to previous elections. The BJP plans to focus on highlighting its government's achievements without emphasizing a chief ministerial face, while the Congress aims to address youth unemployment, inflation, corruption, and farmers' unrest. Both parties are also offering a wishlist of freebies to attract voters. Madhya Pradesh has become a stronghold for the BJP in the last two decades, with the exception of a brief period in 2018 when the Congress came to power but couldn't sustain it due to defections to the BJP. The election will be influenced by the results of the 2018 election and the subsequent Congress government's failure. Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan's popularity is significant, but there is also an air of fatigue among voters. Factionalism and infighting within both parties are a challenge, and the denial of tickets to sitting MLAs has caused dissent. The election outcome will be influenced by regional dynamics, as different regions have distinct voting patterns. The BJP's focus on individual beneficiary-oriented schemes has gained support among women but has disappointed unemployed youth. The Congress is raising issues of unemployment, corruption, inflation, and farmer unrest, as well as offering a list of freebies to counter the BJP's campaign. Both parties are also addressing concerns regarding the representation of OBCs and STs. The election is expected to be a close fight between the BJP and Congress, with the potential for surprise results in some areas. Dissension within both parties and the impact of third-party candidates could also affect the outcome.

Recently, the central and state GST authorities have issued demand notices to various companies across sectors, such as consumer durables, smartphones, insurance, online gaming, and service providers. LIC received a notice of Rs 290.5 crore, HDFC Life Insurance received a notice of Rs 942 crore, Dabur received a notice of Rs 320 crore, and Delta Corp received notices amounting to thousands of crores. The notices largely pertain to the initial period after the shift to the GST regime, which was marked by uncertainty and teething problems. Concerns have been raised about the multiplicity of notices, lack of a uniform process, and coordination between the center and state tax authorities. State tax authorities have even sought information based on media reports of a company's merger. GST notices have also been sent to multinational companies regarding the levy of tax on expats and seconded employees. The GST system has experienced constant tweaking and significant leakages. Cases of fake input tax credit have been detected, resulting in tax evasion of over Rs 57,000 crore. The tax system should focus on simplifying tax rules, reducing uncertainty and discretion, and easing compliance burdens to minimize litigation and promote fair tax payments.

### [Mani Shankar Aiyar writes: First came Zionist terror](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/mani-shankar-aiyar-writes-first-came-zionist-terror-8999423/)

This article discusses the history of Zionist terrorism in Israel and its impact on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It highlights the involvement of future Prime Ministers of Israel, such as Menachem Begin, in terrorist groups like Lehi and Irgun. These groups collaborated with Haganah and Palmach, armed wings of the Zionist forces, to carry out acts of violence, sabotage, and assassination. The article also mentions the role of the Jewish Agency, led by David Ben-Gurion and Golda Meir, in supporting these terrorist activities. The origins of Zionist terrorism can be traced back to a division between Chaim Weizmann and Vladimir Jabotinsky, with Weizmann advocating for a Jewish state through British imperialism and Jabotinsky promoting terrorism as a means to achieve their goals. The article lists various acts of terror committed by these groups, including bombings, mine-laying, hijackings, and assassinations. It emphasizes that Israel was born out of terrorism and that terrorizing Palestinians has been a key element in Israeli policies towards them. The article concludes by stating that peace can only be achieved through dialogue and justice for all parties involved.

### [An Israeli journalist writes: On Hamas, Congress is morally bankrupt and politically irresponsible](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/on-hamas-congress-is-morally-bankrupt-politically-irresponsible-8999406/)

The article criticizes the Congress party's response to the October 7 massacre perpetrated by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) in Israel. The author expresses disbelief at how a party that once advocated non-violence and peaceful protests could explain away such a tragic event. The article highlights the high number of civilian casualties and injured individuals resulting from the massacre. The Israeli response is described as a full-scale war, with aerial strikes on Gaza and troops amassed along the borders. The author argues that any support from Congress for those responsible for the massacre is morally bankrupt and politically irresponsible. The article also discusses the geopolitical implications of aligning with groups like Hamas, particularly the support they receive from Iran, Russia, and Qatar. The author warns that jihadists view Hindus as idol worshippers and pose a threat domestically. They argue that a weak India could face similar violence and consequences as France, with communal riots and terrorist attacks. The article concludes by suggesting that Congress leaders need to show more backbone in their response to this issue.

### [Meet Rahul Mishra’s tailor — on Selena Gomez’s dress](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/meet-rahul-mishras-tailor-on-selena-gomezs-dress-8998896/)

The article discusses the growing question of ethics within the Indian fashion industry. While the industry has seen success on the global stage, there is concern about whether designers are genuinely committed to inclusivity and sustainability or if it is all for show. The article highlights a recent instance where designer Rahul Mishra paid tribute to his master tailor, Munir Ahmed, by featuring his image on a dress worn by Selena Gomez. This gesture brought attention to the often-hidden heroes behind fashion creations and emphasized the need for recognition and fair treatment of artisans. The article calls for a shift towards transparency in the industry, with designers announcing the salaries, perks, and working conditions of their entire workforce. It also mentions designers like Stella McCartney and Sabyasachi Mukherjee who are already championing principles of transparency, sustainability, and ethical fashion. The article concludes by urging for a future where every creator and artisan is given their due respect and acknowledgement, with Gen Z as torchbearers of change in the fashion world.

### [Marriage equality and the test of judicial greatness](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/marriage-equality-and-the-test-of-judicial-greatness-8998631/)

The Indian Supreme Court recently made an important decision regarding the rights of the LGBT community, specifically regarding same-sex marriage. The judges were divided on how to address the discrimination faced by the community within the existing legal framework. The minority opinion, led by Chief Justice Chandrachud and joined by Justice Kaul, emphasized empathy and inclusivity, proposing the idea of an intimate association or civil union to provide a constitutional home for LGBTQ couples. They issued directions to ensure government and law enforcement agencies support these associations. However, the minority opinion could have gone further by directing parliament to remedy the discrimination or overseeing the government committee's proposed solution. The majority opinion, on the other hand, strictly adhered to the black letter of the law and constitution, leading to criticism that it lacked relief for the petitioners. The article argues that the law should adapt to the evolving needs of society, and judges should find ways to grant relief, even if unconventional. The court's duty as a countermajoritarian institution is to provide concrete relief that helps level the legislative playing field. Overall, the article hopes for a future court that actively contributes to rectifying the discriminatory practices faced by the LGBTQ community.

### [After Bihar caste survey, Mandal vs Kamandal, again](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/mandal-vs-kamandal-again-8998026/)

The Bihar Government recently released the report of a caste survey conducted in the state, which has sparked public debate and political analysis. The report acknowledges the existence of caste identities in society, something that has been opposed by certain political parties and civil society groups. However, these same parties consider caste identities when distributing tickets for elections and designing welfare schemes. The report brings social justice back into the political agenda, as it highlights the importance of caste in society. It also challenges the BJP's focus on Hindu identity politics and raises questions about the 50% cap on quotas set by the Supreme Court. The report may lead to unintended consequences as political parties mobilize different caste groups, and it poses a challenge to the BJP's upper-caste constituency. The outcome will depend on how political parties mobilize these caste communities and how caste blocs respond to the report.

### [Christophe Jaffrelot writes: The West, China, a world in flux — and where India stands](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/world-in-flux-where-india-stands-8998025/)

The article discusses India's position in the changing international scene and its relationship with China. The author argues that recent developments, such as the expansion of the BRICS grouping and China's growing influence, are leading to a more bipolar world. This poses challenges for India's strategy of engaging with multiple powers to maximize its national interest. The author suggests that India may need to take sides and align more closely with the West, as evidenced by its participation in initiatives like the Quad and joint maneuvers with Western powers. However, India faces limitations in fully aligning with the West due to its dependence on Russia for energy and weapons, as well as its trade dependence on China. The article concludes by questioning whether India is truly at the center of international affairs or stuck in the middle due to its dependence on various players.

### [Even as outlook on inflation improves, RBI must continue to remain vigilant](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/surge-and-fall-8998017/)

The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in India is focused on reducing inflation to the central bank's target of 4%. Inflation had surged in July and August due to soaring food prices, but the MPC chose to look past this surge as it was believed to be temporary. The September data confirmed that food prices have corrected sharply, validating the committee's decision to maintain the status quo. Vegetable prices, which have a significant impact on inflation, rose sharply in July but fell in September as fresh supplies entered the market. However, vegetable inflation has been increasing in recent years, with frequent price spikes due to supply-demand mismatches and production fluctuations. The outlook on food prices has improved in recent weeks following rains and a less severe impact of El Nino. The RBI's latest forecast shows a projected decrease in inflation, but the MPC needs to remain vigilant to prevent any spillover effects on underlying inflation trends. The committee's main objective is to ensure price stability.

### [Climate change has made it harder to breathe in Mumbai](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/breathless-in-mumbai-8998013/)

Mumbai, India has been experiencing a air quality crisis during the post-monsoon period for the second year in a row. The Air Quality Index (AQI) in the city has consistently been "moderate" or "poor" throughout October, with no "good" air days. While the pollution is mainly caused by coarser particles that are less harmful than finer particles, meteorological conditions play a role in exacerbating the issue. Mumbai's geography, with its strong surface winds and sea breeze, usually helps disperse pollutants. However, unfavourable meteorological conditions during the post-monsoon season have led to poor air quality. Last winter, Mumbai experienced record-breaking particulate pollution due to unusual climate conditions. This year, delayed monsoon withdrawal and weak ventilation have contributed to worsening air quality. Dust emissions from development and construction activities also play a significant role. On some days this month, Mumbai's AQI was worse than Delhi's, but overall, Mumbai's air quality is still better. Long-term mitigation planning and addressing anthropogenic emissions are crucial in combating air pollution in Mumbai. Short-term measures include cordon off construction sites, spraying water to dampen dust particles, implementing fossil fuel-less transportation, and ensuring smooth traffic flow. Transitioning to electric vehicles, improving solid waste management, cleaning up dumping grounds, and managing industrial toxins can improve air quality in the medium term. It is important to prioritize these changes given the seriousness of climate change.

Natalie Zemon Davis, a Canadian-American historian, passed away at the age of 94. She was known for her book "The Return of Martin Guerre," which tells the story of a 16th-century French farmer who impersonated another farmer. Davis reconstructed the story, focusing on the perspectives of the missing farmer's wife and offering insights into gender relations at the time. Davis also wrote a pamphlet protesting the red hunt in American institutions, which resulted in her losing her US passport for eight years. She was a champion for social justice and campaigned for public funding for the social sciences. Davis's works demonstrate the importance of social history and paying attention to seemingly insignificant events.

### [BJP’s rath prabhari circular — the bureaucracy must be neutral and independent](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/officer-and-prabhari-8998014/)

The circular issued by the Department of Revenue, Ministry of Finance, appointing bureaucrats as "rath prabharis" to showcase the achievements of the Indian government has sparked a political controversy. The Congress party has accused the BJP of politicizing the bureaucracy and using civil servants for government propaganda before elections. The BJP, on the other hand, argues that public servants should reach out to ensure the success of government schemes. The involvement of bureaucrats in scheme delivery is not an issue, but the problem lies in the framing of their task as "showcasing" and "celebrating" government achievements. The bureaucracy must maintain neutrality and independence, especially in polarized times. The notion of a "committed bureaucracy" that prioritizes the ruling party's agenda over their job is not new, and it is important for the BJP to respect the principle of non-political domains to maintain public trust in the system's functioning.

### [Bombay High Court’s ‘salaam’ to art without borders](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bombay-high-courts-ban-pakistani-artistes-8997779/)

The article discusses the cultural connections between India and Pakistan that go beyond the traumatic past and divided present caused by partition. It highlights the shared heritage of language, movies, music, food, poetry, and sports that bind the two nations. The author mentions various artists and songs from both countries that have garnered affection and appreciation from people on both sides of the border. However, political tensions have hindered collaborations and exchanges, leading to bans on Pakistani artists working in India. The internet has provided some relief by enabling access to Pakistani artists' work but has not facilitated collaboration. The recent decision by the Bombay High Court rejected a plea to ban working with Pakistani artists, emphasizing the power of art, music, sports, culture, and dance to bring peace, unity, and harmony. The article concludes by highlighting the camaraderie between the Indian and Pakistani cricket teams and the ability of the arts to bridge differences and foster collaboration.

### [On Palestine and Israel, Gandhi’s doublespeak on non-violence](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/palestine-israel-conflict-mahatma-gandhi-non-violence-8997676/)

This article discusses Mahatma Gandhi's views on Palestine and the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The author argues that the widely quoted statement, "Palestine belongs to the Arabs," is often misconstrued and misunderstood. The ongoing Israel-Hamas violence has led to the resurrection of this quote, but the author points out that many people who use this quote conveniently ignore Gandhi's other positions and cherry-pick his statements. The author raises questions about Gandhi's consistency on the issue and whether he truly understood the complexities of the conflict. According to his own admission, Gandhi only understood Judaism through the lens of Christianity and did not appreciate the Jewish longing for a homeland. The author also highlights the absence of references and details of Gandhi's meetings with Jewish leaders in his collected works, suggesting a lack of sympathy towards Jews and Zionism. The author concludes that Gandhi's views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict were not consistent, as he demanded non-violence from Jews but understood Arab violence against what they perceived as an encroachment on their land. The article argues that Gandhi couldn't live up to his own standards of non-violence when it came to Palestine.

### [Urgently need: A law to protect consumers from deep fake ads](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/law-deep-fake-ads-anil-kapoor-personality-rights-8997267/)

A recent interim order by the Delhi High Court has affirmed the personality rights of actor Anil Kapoor and stated that using technological dark patterns, including deepfakes, to deceive consumers for commercial purposes violates personality rights and goes beyond freedom of speech. Dark patterns are deceptive practices used to mislead users, and with the rise of artificial intelligence, they are becoming more sophisticated. This includes companies using morphed videos/photos of celebrities to sell products/services, spreading fake political propaganda, selling exclusive pornographic content, and sharing deepfake videos/images for followers and sponsorships. While consumer rights laws can encompass the use of deepfakes, most perpetrators are unknown, making it difficult for courts to impose monetary or punitive consequences. The recent order could lead to more cases filed by celebrities defending their personality rights and consumers against celebrities, advertisers, and social media platforms. Social media platforms have a responsibility to ensure that advertisements featuring deepfakes do not run on their platforms. It is important for the government to implement preventive measures and regulate online platforms to address deepfake advertisements. The US government has proposed the Deep Fakes Accountability Bill, 2023, and it may be argued that existing laws in India are sufficient to combat deepfake dark patterns and protect personality rights. However, there is a need for harmonization of laws and comprehensive definitions to effectively regulate AI and its use in the consumer market. Guidelines should be issued under the Consumer Protection Act to mandate disclosure of deepfake usage in advertisements. Ultimately, it is up to the government to protect consumers from increasingly sophisticated deepfake advertisements.

### [One step closer to an Indian astronaut in space](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/one-step-closer-to-an-indian-astronaut-in-space-8996664/)

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) conducted its first test for the Gaganyaan mission, which aims to send an Indian astronaut into space within the next two years. The test focused on the project's safety system and experienced a two-hour delay due to a snag in the ignition rocket. However, ISRO scientists quickly identified and corrected the issue. The test involved launching a rocket carrying a payload consisting of the Crew Escape System and a crew module 17 km into the atmosphere. The crew module is crucial for ensuring astronauts' safety and comfort during the mission. ISRO prioritizes crew safety and wants to ensure that astronauts can return to safety in case of emergencies. The agency's request to relax timelines for the mission was driven by considerations of crew safety. This recent trial brings ISRO closer to making Gaganyaan's systems foolproof. The agency's Policy Planning Committee endorsed a crewed space mission in 2004, and it has taken nearly 20 years to conduct safety trials, highlighting the complexity of human spaceflight compared to other missions like Mars or Moon exploration. ISRO faces the challenge of developing a module that can transport humans to an orbit of 400 km and bring them back safely. The success of Chandrayaan, ISRO's recent lunar mission, has boosted confidence in its human spaceflight venture. The same launch vehicle used for Chandrayaan was used in Saturday's trial, although a lighter rocket was used. ISRO also worked on parachute systems to ensure a safe landing in water after the mission. The trial demonstrated the success of this emergency escape mechanism and collected data for future tests and the final mission. In upcoming trials, ISRO will test more complex safety mechanisms and plans to send a robot to space as a prelude to the crewed mission. The agency has wisely chosen not to finalize Gaganyaan's launch yet, and its trials will be closely watched in the coming months.

The Bombay High Court has dismissed a petition seeking a ban on Pakistani artists working in India, stating that cross-border cultural cooperation promotes peace and unity. The petitioner had requested directives from various ministries to prohibit the employment of Pakistani actors, technicians, singers, musicians, and lyricists in India. In recent years, political tensions between India and Pakistan have affected arts, culture, and sports exchanges. However, such exchanges have the potential to improve relationships burdened by shared trauma and nationalistic narratives. The court's decision recognizes the positive impact of sports and cultural exchanges in fostering reconciliation and hope among people.

### [Where politics of caste goes wrong](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/casteism-social-justice-social-equality-caste-politics-8996657/)

The article discusses the importance of caste enumeration for an honest appraisal of social inequalities in India. The author argues that caste is the biggest determinant of life chances, and counting and analyzing caste is necessary to combat social inequalities. However, the politics of caste often hinder honest counting and appraisal due to its role in consolidating power for political dynasties. The article also highlights the formation of cream layers within reserved caste categories, where certain castes monopolize the benefits of reservations, leaving other marginalized castes and subcastes disadvantaged. This phenomenon is attributed to the early beneficiaries of reservations building powerful social and cultural capital. The article suggests that in order to address social inequality, it is necessary to confront not just caste but also the institution of the Indian family, which perpetuates nepotism and class differentiation. The author also points out that the focus on caste politics diverts attention from the need to build and nurture public institutions, particularly in education and healthcare. The article concludes by stating that dismantling institutions that perpetuate elitism is necessary for the politics of equality, but building and sustaining public institutions require a certain degree of cultural pride that leans towards elitism.

The upcoming assembly elections in Rajasthan will determine whether the BJP or the Congress will come to power. Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot of the Congress party has launched "Mission 156" with the goal of winning 156 seats, while also launching "Mission 2030" to make Rajasthan the top state in the country. However, factionalism within the Congress and issues such as question paper leaks, law and order problems, and corruption allegations may affect their chances. The BJP is relying on Prime Minister Narendra Modi's leadership and has made promises and declarations of sops to gain support. Other political parties also play a role in the elections, securing about 10% of votes and seats in the assembly. The increase in women voters and young voters will also be crucial factors in determining the outcome of the elections.

India and Canada's bilateral relations have worsened due to allegations of India's involvement in the killing of a Khalistani extremist on Canadian soil. Canada has accused India of unilaterally revoking the diplomatic immunity of Canadian diplomats, violating international law. However, India argues that it asked Canada to reduce the size of its mission based on the principle of parity, not revoking their immunity. India has the right to ask Canada to limit the size of its mission under Article 11(1) of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations (VCDR). This provision allows the receiving state to determine what is "reasonable and normal" considering domestic circumstances. International law supports India's actions, as other countries have used this provision to limit diplomatic missions. Additionally, if Canadian diplomats were interfering in India's internal affairs, it would be a breach of the VCDR by Canada. Both countries need to work towards building trust and resolving their differences.

The article discusses three different news items. 

The first news is about two massive explosions in Beirut that resulted in the deaths of more than 145 American and French soldiers. One explosion occurred at the American marine force headquarters at Beirut international airport, killing over 120 American servicemen and injuring over 100. The other explosion happened in a building in the center of the city where French soldiers were stationed, resulting in the deaths of over 25 of them.

The second news is about the United Front, a five-party coalition, urging the center to resume talks on Punjab without delay. They also appealed to the Akali Dal, a political party, to suspend their agitation in order to facilitate negotiations. The United Front accused the government of pursuing a confrontational path and dishonestly blaming the opposition for the problems in Punjab.

The third news is about the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) demanding the reorganization of some large states into smaller and more manageable units for better administration. The BJP advocates for a strong center as well as states, opposing the proposal made by some opposition parties to limit the center's jurisdiction to defense, external affairs, currency, and communications.

Lastly, the article mentions that the move to introduce a five-day week and round-the-clock operations in all industries has not obtained support from the Union Labour Ministry. The ministry believes that these measures may not necessarily lead to increased productivity and a blanket decision for a five-day week could be counterproductive.

Bishan Singh Bedi was a legendary figure in the world of sports, known for his immense talent and fighting spirit. He was a believer who found his passion for cricket at a young age. Bedi's skill as a spin bowler was unmatched, with his ability to deceive batsmen and control the ball's movement. He never boasted about his own abilities but admired his fellow spin colleagues. Bedi enjoyed when batsmen hit him for sixes, as it meant he had successfully tricked them into thinking they had the upper hand. However, Bedi's story goes beyond his on-field accomplishments. He was also a rebel captain, seeking justice and advocating for the marginalized. He faced numerous controversies and accusations throughout his career but remained fearless in expressing his opinions. Bedi fought for better amenities for players and spoke out against injustices both on and off the field. Despite facing hardships, he approached life with gratitude and brought joy to those around him with his humor and storytelling abilities.

Bishan Singh Bedi, a legendary cricketer, passed away on Monday, leaving a void in Indian cricket. Known for his exceptional left-arm orthodox spin, Bedi was a master of deception with his slow run-up, smooth action, and varied deliveries. He took 266 wickets in Tests and 1,560 wickets in first-class cricket. Bedi played a crucial role in India's first Test victories in England and West Indies in 1970-71. Beyond his cricketing skills, Bedi was a jovial and amiable person who made lifelong friends wherever he went. Though his captaincy was not highly successful, he instilled a sense of identity and led by example. Bedi was known for his strong opinions, which sometimes drew criticism. However, he always stood up for his team and played a significant role in shaping modern Indian cricket. He had zero tolerance for chucking and was skeptical of doosra-bowling off-spinners. Bedi's love and dedication were evident in his commitment to Indian cricket.

The recent controversy surrounding a member of parliament allegedly granting access to her member's portal for filing critical questions has overshadowed the importance of discussing the modalities of filing parliamentary questions in a democracy. Parliamentary questions are a tool that allows MPs to gather information from the government related to policies, implementation of programs, and developmental matters. There are two types of questions: starred questions that require an oral answer in the house and unstarred questions that receive written answers. There are also short notice questions and questions for private members. However, the productivity of the question hour has been declining, with only a small percentage of questions being answered in recent sessions. MPs file questions through a member's portal, but they have no control over the process and there is no guarantee that their questions will be chosen. Additionally, questions can be rejected without proper reasoning and sometimes modified by the secretariats. India lacks an effective mechanism for directly posing questions to the Prime Minister. The declining importance of the question hour is attributed to procedural roadblocks, low productivity, and lack of direct accountability of the Prime Minister. It is important to address these shortcomings to ensure that questions effectively fulfill their purpose of holding the government accountable.

### [A narrow medical view on abortion endangers women’s agency](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/abortion-narrow-medical-view-women-agency-8995992/)

In less than a year, the Supreme Court in India has taken contradictory positions on the rights of pregnant women to have abortions. In a case on September 29, 2022, the court emphasized the importance of a woman's right to make reproductive choices without interference from the state. However, on October 16, another court ruling denied a woman the choice to have an abortion because her pregnancy had exceeded 24 weeks, even though the fetus was healthy and her mental health condition was manageable. This decision prioritized a narrow medical opinion over the woman's choice. 

In the US, abortion rights have been debated, with anti-abortion activists and conservative judges arguing against the rights of pregnant women. In India, the courts have generally supported pregnant women's rights to expand the boundaries of their reproductive rights. Recent activism led to an amendment to the law allowing medical termination up to 24 weeks of gestation, and beyond that, with a medical board's advice, in cases of fetal deformity or risk to the woman's life. 

However, the latest Supreme Court ruling may indicate limits to judicial activism in extending the right to abortion beyond 24 weeks. The case involved a woman who was more than 24 weeks pregnant and requested an abortion, but the medical board determined that the fetus was viable and healthy. A disagreement among the judges led to uncertainty about whether the abortion should be allowed. One danger signal is that the courts are giving too much weight to a limited medical opinion at the expense of a woman's self-determination. Another concern is the focus on the viability of the fetus, which diminishes the woman's decision-making power. The sudden emphasis on "foeticide" and "beating heart" suggests a bias toward the rights of the fetus over the rights of the woman. 

The writer emphasizes the importance of recognizing and addressing these danger signals to protect women's rights to abortion in India, especially in light of recent developments in the US that have rolled back abortion rights.

The article also addresses the cultural expectations placed on women to make marriages work and the need to prioritize individual well-being over societal pressures. It concludes by advocating for celebrating the act of leaving a bad marriage as much as finding a suitable partner, emphasizing the value and importance of daughters.

The Women's Reservation Bill, also known as the Nari Shakti Vandan Adhiniyam, was passed by Parliament in September. This bill is a significant achievement for the women's movement in India and calls for women to recognize their agency and assume equal responsibilities as citizens. The journey for the bill's approval took 27 years, but the movement for women's participation in politics predates Independence. The article argues that implementing mandatory quotas for women can transition politics from rhetoric to presence, ensuring fair negotiations and deliberations between genders. It also highlights the historical contributions of women in various movements and their increasing presence in fields such as education, aviation, and governance. The article concludes by advocating for reflective autonomy, which combines engagement, emancipation, and empathy, to achieve substantive equality for women.

Rishi Sunak, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, is facing challenges as he approaches one year in office. Despite bringing stability to the government, Sunak is dealing with rising inflation, elongated NHS waiting times, increasing national debt, and slow economic growth. The recent by-election losses to Labour indicate a potential shift in British politics. Sunak's focus should be on combating inflation, targeted investment in infrastructure and education, a competitive tax regime, and a fit-for-purpose approach to immigration. He should also prioritize building alliances with countries like India and rebuilding relationships with European allies. Sunak needs to address voter concerns and provide a hopeful vision for the future while managing the tension between lower taxes and increased spending. The support of the Tory party will be crucial for his success.

### [President Biden’s Israel visit: Diplomacy in crisis](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/president-bidens-israel-visit-diplomacy-in-crisis-8995245/)

US President Joe Biden traveled to Israel to address the crisis caused by Hamas' attack, showing great personal risk. The Israeli military response has resulted in more Palestinian deaths and a humanitarian crisis in Northern Gaza. Despite the challenges, Biden aimed to create space for diplomacy. However, the bombing of a hospital in Gaza overshadowed his visit and led to the cancellation of a planned summit in Jordan. Western allies, including Germany and the UK, are supporting Biden's efforts. Their solidarity with Israel remains unwavering, but they also urge caution and humanitarian aid for Gaza. They are working with Qatar to secure the release of hostages held in Gaza and plan for a post-Hamas regime with Arab support. This highlights the paradox that while the US is seen as declining, it remains the major power capable of promoting moderation in the region. However, obstacles remain, as Netanyahu may delay but not abandon plans for an invasion, and moderate Arab states struggle with anti-Israeli sentiment among their populations. Despite some positive developments like hostage releases and aid reaching Gaza, these gains may be short-lived once Israel's invasion begins.

### [BJP’s Sufi dialogue may be an attempt to keep its core ideology open-ended](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/bjps-sufi-dialogue-may-be-an-attempt-to-keep-its-core-ideology-open-ended-8995205/)

The BJP's Sufi Samvad Maha Abhiyan aims to establish communication with Muslim communities through spiritual leaders associated with Sufi shrines. The party's objective is not to make Sufis join the BJP, but rather to understand the problems and demands of Muslim communities. There are two explanations for this outreach: an election-centric approach to expand the BJP's electoral base among Muslims, and a strategy to create a divide among Muslims in order to consolidate the Hindutva constituency. However, it is important to situate the BJP's Sufi outreach within the intellectual framework of contemporary Hindutva and understand its political-electoral expectations from Sufis. The RSS chief Mohan Bhagwat has stated that Hindutva is synonymous with patriotism and that Hindu Rashtra does not exclude Muslims. This ambiguity in the BJP's adherence to Hindutva allows for programs like the Sufi outreach. The BJP's electoral success is linked to its professional attitude and focus on winnability. While initiatives like the Sufi outreach may not provide immediate electoral advantages, they help protect and expand the party's support base by creating a configuration where Hindutva and Sufi devotion can coexist without confrontation.

The article discusses the allegations against Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra, who is accused of accepting cash and gifts from a businessman in exchange for asking questions in Parliament. The matter is currently with the Ethics Committee of Lok Sabha, but the article questions whether the truth or falsehood of the allegations really matters in today's social media-driven political landscape. It suggests that the case has already achieved its intended purpose of tarnishing Moitra's image and reinforcing the BJP's narrative of Modi versus the opposition. The article also highlights the impatience and disregard for due process of justice, which it attributes to factors such as the BJP's desire to dismantle existing institutions and norms, as well as the declining credibility of media institutions. It warns that important issues may be treated cavalierly during election campaigns, further compromising society's ability to navigate complex problems.

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has returned from a four-year exile in the UK and expressed his intention to participate in the upcoming general elections in January 2024. The media has largely favored his return, although there are concerns about the economic policies of his party, the PML-N. In other news, the Pakistan Cricket Board has lodged a complaint over "inappropriate conduct" towards the Pakistan cricket team during their match against India. The media in Pakistan criticized the behavior of the crowd and called for action from the ICC and BCCI. US President Joe Biden's visit to Israel was also discussed, with media outlets in Pakistan commenting on his silence over the strike on a hospital in Gaza. The Pakistan Stock Exchange reached a milestone by reaching the 50,000 mark on the KSE-100 index for the first time in six years, which is seen as a sign of growing investor confidence. Finally, Pakistan achieved its first-ever FIFA World Cup qualifier victory, bringing hope for the future of football in the country.

### [Same-sex marriage judgment asks queer citizens to wait for true equality at a future time that may never arrive](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/same-sex-marriage-judgment-supreme-court-equality-law-queer-8994511/)

The article discusses the disappointment and frustration felt by many queer citizens and their allies following the Supreme Court's judgment in the marriage equality case. The Court did not grant any of the reliefs sought by the petitioners, stating that there was no fundamental right to marriage and upholding adoption guidelines that prevent unmarried couples from adopting. While the right of transgender persons to marry was upheld, it was already established by an earlier decision. The Court argues that amending marriage laws is the responsibility of the legislature and declares that the Special Marriage Act is not discriminatory. The article criticizes the Court for not taking a stronger stance against legal discrimination and suggests that its solution of forming a committee is unsatisfactory. It concludes by highlighting the need for true equality and justice for queer citizens.

The author expresses their support for Israel and condemns the actions of Hamas terrorists. They argue that the world has quickly forgotten the violence inflicted on Israel by Hamas and that Palestinians are also victims of Hamas terrorism. The author criticizes Muslims who protest against Israel but not against Hamas, and highlights the Palestinian ambassador's statement that hostages could be released if the bombing stopped. The author believes that depriving the people of Gaza of basic necessities is inhumane and a war crime. They caution against a ground war and warn that a new jihadist group may emerge if Hamas is eliminated. The author also discusses the ideology of jihadism and its presence in Muslim countries, even those considered liberal and moderate. They express disappointment in Muslim friends who support Gaza without understanding the reasons behind the siege or acknowledging Israel's experiences. The article concludes by mentioning an upcoming anniversary of a terrorist attack in Mumbai and reflects on past conspiracy theories blaming intelligence agencies for such attacks.

### [P Chidambaram writes: Dark Shadow over Love](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/dark-shadow-over-love-8994101/)

This article discusses the recent judgment by the Indian Supreme Court regarding the civil rights of LGBTQIA+ individuals, particularly in relation to marriage. The article highlights that while laws have historically recognized and granted rights to heterosexual couples, there has been a lack of legal recognition for same-sex relationships. The article mentions that Section 377 of the Indian Penal Code, which criminalized consensual homosexuality, was only overturned in 2018. The recent judgment by the Supreme Court addressed some issues related to LGBTQIA+ rights but left others unresolved. It states that there is still hesitancy among political parties and individuals to take a firm position on these matters due to their intimate nature and far-reaching consequences. The article also notes that while the court recognized the right to choose a partner irrespective of gender, it did not go as far as granting same-sex couples the right to adopt children or other legal protections such as maintenance, inheritance, and succession. Overall, the article suggests that while progress has been made with this judgment, there is still a long way to go in terms of achieving full equality for LGBTQIA+ individuals in India.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau has accused India of "credible allegations" of involvement in the death of Khalistani gangster Hardeep Singh Nijjar. The Canadian government's assumption is reportedly based on telephone intercepts provided by the US government. However, proving such allegations in the world of terrorism, which is linked to drug cartels and other illegal activities, is difficult. Several anti-India terrorists have died abroad, allegedly in inter-gang rivalries. The forthcoming Assembly polls in several Indian states are expected to favor the Congress party, but this does not suit its alliance partners in the I.N.D.I.A. group. Meanwhile, Akhilesh Yadav is threatening to contest all seats in Uttar Pradesh in the parliamentary poll since the Congress has not shared any Assembly seats in Madhya Pradesh.

This article discusses two incidents that occurred 44 years apart in Deoria district, Uttar Pradesh, and highlights the changes in political response over time. The first incident took place in 1980 when a bus ran over an old woman in Narainpur village, leading to police violence against villagers. The incident gained political significance as it coincided with Indira Gandhi's return to power and put Chief Minister Banarasi Das in a difficult position. The second incident occurred in 2023 when a land dispute between two families in Fatehpur resulted in a murderous assault. However, the response from politicians, particularly those from the ruling BJP party, was focused on representing their own caste rather than standing up for the victims. This shift reflects the changing nature of politics and the principles politicians uphold.

The Supreme Court has denied a married woman permission to terminate her pregnancy, which had exceeded the legal limit of 24 weeks. The woman, who already has two children, cited postpartum depression and lactational amenorrhea as reasons for wanting an abortion. The court ruled that termination was not immediately necessary based on reports from a medical board. The case sparked debates about foetal viability, a woman's right over her body, and the rights of unborn children. The article argues that if society cannot provide for unwanted children, women should have the right to decide whether or not to keep their babies.

### [Hamas attack on Israel: The problem with over relying on technology](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/hamas-attack-israel-technology-8993736/)

The recent attacks on Israel have been compared to 9/11 and the 26/11 terror strikes in Mumbai, but these comparisons ignore historical contexts. However, it is clear that these attacks were intelligence failures. Israel has heavily relied on technology for its security, including surveillance cameras, drones, biometric systems, and data mining techniques. Despite these measures, the attackers were able to evade detection and carry out their plans. It is unclear how they were able to do so without leaving digital footprints or communicating with each other. The Iron Dome missile defense system provided some protection, but it is not foolproof. Some experts argue that Israel's over-reliance on technology may have been a mistake and that a balance of human intelligence and signals intelligence is necessary. The failures in this situation highlight the importance of solving real-world problems rather than relying solely on technology.

It highlights the conflicting views on whether the foetus should be considered in abortion regulation and the impact of this on women's rights.

### [We will get past the marriage equality hiccup and fight on](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/marriage-equality-supreme-court-fight-8993409/)

The Supreme Court of India has refused to recognize queer marriages and civil unions in a recent verdict on marriage equality. The court heard about 20 petitions from the LGBTQIA+ community seeking recognition of queer marriages under various marriage acts. Despite opposition from the central government, the court decided to hear the matter. However, it narrowed down the scope of the hearing to just the Special Marriage Act. The court suggested the creation of a committee to discuss granting certain rights to queer couples, but did not provide details on its implementation. The majority judgment also denied adoption rights to queer couples. This verdict highlights a larger problem of constitutional courts turning conservative and passing responsibility to the executive branch. The article emphasizes the need for continued activism and advocacy for equal rights for the queer community, including issues such as transgender rights, anti-discrimination laws, and protection from abuse and unsafe environments. The author encourages mobilization, especially in smaller towns and villages, to create a safer and more equal society for future generations.

Adania Shibli's novel Minor Detail, which explores violence and dispossession in the context of the rape of a young Arab woman by Israeli troops in 1949, has faced controversy at the Frankfurt Book Fair. The award ceremony for the novel was postponed due to concerns about the volatile situation in West Asia, leading to criticism from over 600 writers, including Nobel and Booker Prize winners. This attempt to silence voices of protest is not unique to Frankfurt, as universities in the US have also faced pushbacks against students speaking up for the Palestinian cause. The article highlights the importance of perspective and empathy in conflicts, emphasizing the need to condemn violence against all innocent people regardless of political ideology. The actions taken to silence writers, cartoonists, students, and protestors reveal the limitations of a public rectitude that prioritizes appearing "fair" and "balanced" over genuine empathy.

Virat Kohli, once considered past his prime, has proven his critics wrong by showcasing his rejuvenated form in the ongoing World Cup. Despite speculation about his abilities, Kohli's decision to take a break at the end of last year has paid off. At 34 years old, he played with the energy of a player in his 20s and scored an unbeaten century against Bangladesh. Kohli now has 48 ODI tons, just one behind Sachin Tendulkar's record. While some may question the manner in which he achieved his century, it ultimately helped boost India's net run rate. Kohli's current form is a cause for concern for future opponents, and if he and his teammates continue performing well, India may have much to celebrate in the coming weeks. Despite approaching 35 years old, Kohli shows no signs of slowing down and has many more records to break and World Cups to win.

Street artist Banksy is being sued for defamation for over 1.3 million pounds after using Instagram to encourage shoplifters to target a Guess store. Banksy's anonymous identity raises questions about the legal protection of anonymous artists and creators. The defamation lawsuit alleges that Guess used Banksy's artwork without permission, leading viewers to believe it was stolen. The case may reveal Banksy's true identity, potentially exposing him to charges of trespass and damage to private property. Banksy has also faced legal issues regarding copyright and trademark protection, including a recent ruling that cancelled his European Trademark. The case raises important questions about the rights of anonymous artists and the monopolization of artwork. Indian law recognizes the protection of anonymous works under copyright laws. These legal challenges highlight the tension between protecting an artist's work and maintaining their secretive persona.

The Indian government had previously imposed licensing requirements on the imports of laptops, tablets, and other devices in an effort to boost domestic manufacturing and curb imports from China. However, this move was heavily criticized for resembling the infamous license permit raj era and potentially leading to import quotas and bureaucratic discretion. In response to the criticism, the government has now rolled out an import management system for IT hardware that only requires companies to register and reveal data related to their imports and country of origin. The system aims to monitor imports and ensure they come from trusted sources, with exceptions for special economic zones and essential capital goods. The system will be faceless and contactless to provide a hassle-free experience for importers. However, companies on the "denied entity list" will not receive authorization for imports. While this change in approach is welcome, it highlights concerns over the government's inclination to adopt policies reminiscent of a more controlled economy. Instead, a more conducive environment should be created to foster a strong manufacturing ecosystem with greater openness and freedom to operate.

Sarah Sunny, a deaf advocate, recently became the first person to argue a case in the Supreme Court using Indian Sign Language (ISL). Rahul Bajaj, a blind advocate, also made a case for media accessibility in cinema halls. However, the entertainment industry sees media accessibility as burdensome and costly. This article argues that media accessibility benefits not only people with disabilities but also the general population. Features like Same Language Subtitles or Captions (SLS/SLC) can improve reading literacy and language skills for all viewers. Achieving media accessibility is not as complicated or costly as claimed by the industry. The article proposes including accessibility features as separate files in the Digital Content Package (DCP), making it cost-effective and easily accessible across platforms. Compliance with accessibility standards can be ensured through guidelines set by the Ministry of Information and Broadcasting (MIB). Disability rights groups are advocating for four accessibility features to be included in digital film packages: SLC, AD, translated captions/subtitles, and ISL video interpretation. By making media accessibility a default and choice in content distribution and consumption, all Indians can benefit from it.

### [Ram Madhav writes: Israel should display both strength and righteousness in this war](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/israel-palestine-hamas-war-8992640/)

The recent attack by Hamas on Israel during the Jewish harvest festival of Sukkot has wider implications for Israel and the world. It challenges Israel's image of strength and its ability to neutralize adversaries. The attack exposed intelligence failures and a false sense of complacency within the Israeli system. Political fragmentation in Israel also contributed to a delayed response to the attack. Strategically, the attack jeopardizes Israel's efforts to build bridges with Arab nations and establish diplomatic relations. The conflict could disrupt regional alliances and create a "Great Global Disorder." The political and emotional nature of the conflict complicates matters for Israel, as it faces uprisings in Arab capitals. Hamas may escalate revolts and incite attacks from various directions. Israel views this as a war against terrorism, not against the people of Gaza, and aims to neutralize Hamas and Islamic Jihad. However, it must be cautious about civilian security in Gaza due to the terrorists' use of populated areas as war zones. India expresses support for Israel while upholding its traditional support for a two-state solution in the Israel-Palestine conflict. Ultimately, Israel will fight because it has no other place to go.

It argues that India should encourage moderation in Israel and caution against a planned invasion of Gaza, as military means are unlikely to defeat Hamas and will only isolate Israel further. The article also emphasizes the need to strengthen the moderate voice of the Palestinian Authority against Hamas and recognize the regional ambitions of Iran and Turkey. It concludes by stating that India should support reconciliation between Israel and Palestine and promote a wider coalition of moderate states for its long-term prospects in the Middle East.

The article discusses the recent veto of an anti-caste bill in California and explores the writer's claim of an equivalence between the historical experiences of Jews and Brahmins. The writer argues against the notion of "Hinduphobia" implied in anti-caste legislation proposed in the West, pointing out that Dalits are not part of the Hindu community. The article also addresses claims made by Hindutva supporters about millions of Hindus killed by "Islamic imperialism," particularly during the reign of Aurangzeb. The writer questions the accuracy of these claims and argues that conflicts during that time involved Hindus and Muslims on all sides. The article highlights the role of Brahmins within the Mughal system and their relationship with rulers, suggesting that they were not oppressed but rather held positions of power. It also mentions the exclusion of untouchables from positions of power based on caste. The article concludes by questioning why the writer created a false equivalence between the historical experiences of Brahmins and Jews, suggesting it reflects a lack of historical knowledge.

FPOs are collectives of farmers who work together in a geographical cluster, and they have shown potential in improving productivity, reducing costs, and facilitating market access for farmers. The state government has launched a dedicated FPO cell to support these organizations and aims to form one FPO in each block every year for five years. The FPO Shakti portal has been created to provide a platform for active FPOs in Uttar Pradesh, with close to 1,600 FPOs already registered. The government is also providing incentives such as interest subvention and capital subsidies to encourage FPOs to develop post-harvest infrastructure and engage in crop diversification and value addition. FPOs are playing a crucial role in various sectors, including cereals, horticulture products, pulses, oilseeds, medicinal crops, and sugarcane-based products. They are also collaborating with companies for marketing, input supply, technical dealership, and financial linkage. Additionally, FPOs have successfully registered local products under Geographical Indications (GI) and have contributed to the export of vegetables and fruits from Eastern Uttar Pradesh.

### [Suhas Palshikar writes: Why a caste survey isn’t enough](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/caste-census-plus-8991386/)

The publication of initial statistics from the Bihar caste census has generated cynicism, anxiety, and excitement. The ruling party at the Centre opposes a caste census, claiming it will undermine Hindu unity. Some believe that not counting caste will make it disappear, while others worry that a caste census will encourage sharper caste identities and politicization. However, there is also misplaced excitement surrounding the caste census, with some believing it can counter the BJP's Hindutva. Conducting a caste census is important for informed public policy on social justice, but it does not guarantee a policy shift. The primary numbers from the Bihar census have already sparked discussions about the inadequacy of reservation for OBCs and the principles that should inform the extent of reservation. It is necessary to insist on the publication of all data, particularly socio-economic conditions of caste groups, in order to identify communities trapped in menial work and precarious employment. The next step is to use this data to map backwardness afresh, which may face resistance from numerically larger castes. Finally, efforts should be made to ensure that more backward communities receive affirmative action benefits on a priority basis and to reimagine social justice policy by understanding backwardness holistically and incentivizing inclusion in private employment for those with high backwardness index.

### [Why we need norms on government spending](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/an-expenditure-cap-8991387/)

In a democracy, political parties are voted into office and decide how to spend public money without any referendum on expenditure allocation. The choice of expenditure is controversial, with some believing that governments should prioritize maximizing economic value through capital expenditure. However, more money is often allocated towards "non-development expenditure" which can also empower recipients. Public economics principles emphasize the state's responsibility for fostering equality through redistribution, but the concept of redistribution is nebulous and can be interpreted differently. The common man tends to prefer projects that generate employment and income, rather than ones that make them worse off. If discretionary expenditure was put to a vote, individual choices would likely lean towards "freebies" that benefit the lower-income population. States tend to be more inclined to give freebies as they are closer to the citizens. Some argue that freebies can incentivize production in certain industries. Loan waivers are also seen as fairer than bad loans being written off by banks. Governments face the challenge of deciding where to spend their limited resources, and one solution could be to implement caps and ensure parity across all levels of government. The next Finance Commission may consider drawing up such norms.

The article discusses the recent firing of Steve Bell, a longtime staff cartoonist for The Guardian, due to a controversial drawing of Benjamin Netanyahu. The cartoon depicted the Israeli leader as a surgeon preparing for surgery on himself in Gaza. The editors deemed the image antisemitic and offensive, while Bell claimed it was inspired by a 1960s cartoon by David Levine on US President Lyndon Johnson.

### [Increase in MSP for wheat: A political hike](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/a-political-hike-8991397/)

The Indian government, led by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, has increased the minimum support price (MSP) of wheat for the upcoming 2023-24 rabi season. The MSP has been raised by Rs 150 to Rs 2,275 per quintal, which is the highest increase since the previous United Progressive Alliance (UPA) regime. This decision has both political and economic implications. Politically, it is the last MSP hike before the 2024 Lok Sabha elections and the upcoming state assembly polls. Economically, the increase is driven by high wheat stocks in government warehouses and concerns about water levels and rainfall during the rabi season. However, critics argue that farmers do not need additional incentives to grow wheat as it is a default crop option in many parts of India with access to irrigation. They also suggest that importing wheat could be a viable solution to address tight supplies. Overall, the decision to increase MSP seems to be more politically motivated than economically justified.

### [CM Mann must confront drug scourge in Punjab](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/punjab-vs-drugs-8991396/)

Punjab Chief Minister Bhagwant Mann recently led a prayer gathering of schoolchildren, where they pledged to reject drugs. However, the Opposition sees this as an admission of defeat, as Punjab continues to struggle with drug addiction. The state's vulnerable geography makes it a hotspot for drug smuggling, with heroin and other opioids being brought in from neighboring countries. Previous governments have promised to eradicate drugs, but the problem persists. The current government, led by the AAP, has not been able to stop the influx of drugs, which are often delivered through unconventional means like drones. The police regularly report drug seizures, but their operations mainly target small end-users rather than major players in the drug network. Drug overdose deaths continue to occur, with 266 deaths reported between April 2020 and March 2023. In response, some villages have formed anti-drug committees, and the police have implemented creative approaches to deter youth from drugs, such as gully cricket and mentoring programs. However, the drug mafia needs to be dismantled for a lasting solution. The Punjab police have also faced criticism for their absence in drug trials. Chief Minister Mann must confront this challenge and lead the state to victory in the battle against drugs.

The National Textile Corporation has taken control of thirteen more mills in Bombay, as it continues to struggle to make its existing mills profitable. The government used a presidential ordinance approved by the union cabinet to transfer the management of these mills to the NTC. In other news, the 1983 Nobel Prize for Physics was awarded jointly to Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar and William Fowler.

### [No Indian has the right to marry](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/no-indian-right-to-marry-8991076/)

The article discusses the recent verdict in the Supriya Chakraborty v Union of India case, which dealt with marriage equality. The majority of the bench (3:2) refused to recognize unions other than heterosexual marriages, going against the previous ruling in Navtej Singh Johar (2018) that decriminalized homosexuality. The central government strongly opposed recognizing marriages outside of traditional heterosexual unions. The court emphasized its reluctance to engage in innovative interpretation and stated that there is no fundamental right to marriage under the Indian Constitution. The LGBTQIA+ community and constitutional law teachers were disappointed by the decision, which seemed to prioritize majoritarian morality over constitutional morality. The article questions why the court did not extend the right to union to include matrimonial unions and argues that previous cases have seen the judiciary interpret terms broadly to expand rights protected by the Constitution. The author suggests that the judgment should be reviewed and expresses optimism that judges may change their minds, as has happened in the past.

The article discusses the recently notified Digital Personal Data Protection Act 2023 (DPDPA) in India and its implications for data protection and governance. While the DPDPA is seen as a positive step towards empowering citizens and limiting surveillance and profiling, there are concerns about its implementation at the state level. The article highlights the challenges in managing and standardizing data held by state governments and agencies, as well as the need for revised policies and capacity development in line with the DPDPA. It emphasizes the importance of sustained implementation, allocation of resources, and a culture that values data as an asset. The DPDPA is seen as an opportunity for governments to improve their data ecosystem and enable evidence-driven decision-making, transparency, and accountability. However, it also acknowledges the complexities and trade-offs involved in implementing the act, particularly in dealing with legacy data and adopting modern technologies like artificial intelligence. Overall, the article calls for urgent attention and collaborative efforts to address the data challenges and effectively enforce the DPDPA.

The article highlights Swaminathan's strategic vision and his ability to connect with scientists and policymakers. It also suggests that Indian agriculture needs more champions like Swaminathan who prioritize farmers and focus on sustainable practices.

The Supreme Court in India recently denied a 27-year-old mother of two permission to terminate her unwanted pregnancy. The woman, who is reportedly suffering from mental health issues postpartum, conceived the pregnancy during lactational amenorrhea. The case brought attention to the issue of abortion regulation in India, which is generally considered liberal but has limitations on gestational age. The case was scrutinized by multiple benches of the Supreme Court, with one ruling against the petitioner. The controversy surrounding the case revolves around the use of terms like "foetus," "child," and "baby" and questions of viability. The petitioner argued for her right to reproductive autonomy, citing previous court rulings, but the court did not consider this aspect in its judgment. The article highlights the need for women to have agency over their own bodies and challenges societal expectations of sacrificial womanhood.

The article discusses the recent blast at al-Ahli al-Arabi hospital in Gaza and its implications. Israel has denied responsibility for the attack, claiming it was a result of a failed rocket launch by Hamas. However, the author argues that regardless of who is responsible, the attack has put Israel in a difficult situation from a security and geopolitical perspective. The blast has also overshadowed US President Joe Biden's visit to Israel and has led to protests and the cancellation of a summit-level meeting in Jordan. The article emphasizes that there is no easy way out of the conflict and that a prolonged ground offensive in Gaza will have significant casualties and diplomatic costs. The author calls for a suspension of military action to allow humanitarian aid to reach civilians and for a conversation on how to move forward.

It emphasizes the need for collective action and a shift in mindset from viewing climate-friendly actions as personal choices to recognizing them as part of a larger effort to address climate change.

### [The old Middle East is not back](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-old-middle-east-is-not-back-8989633/)

The article discusses the recent Hamas assault and Israeli counter-offensives, which have brought the Palestinian issue back into the spotlight. The author criticizes the brutality of the Hamas attack, in which around 1,300 people were killed and approximately 150 abducted. This attack has received severe global criticism and undermined the reputation of Hamas and the Palestinian movement. The author argues that while the "old middle east" is back in the short-term, it is unlikely to last, as Hamas cannot fight a long-term war with Israel and regional powers have shown little inclination to escalate the conflict. The author also highlights the division among West Asian states in their support for the Palestinian cause and the unified response of the fractured Israeli government. Israel is determined to prevent Hamas from ruling in Gaza and has garnered Western support for its efforts. The article notes that Hamas sustains the conflict through the backing of Hezbollah and Iran, and without their support, the war would end in a couple of weeks. Iran's support for Hamas is not a secret, and it is working to galvanize support in the Arab world. However, it is likely to avoid direct confrontation with Israel at this time. The article raises concerns about the impact of these developments on Saudi Arabia, which supports Palestinian statehood but has strained ties with Hamas due to its proximity to Iran and Turkey. The Saudis are wary of growing anti-Israel sentiment in the region and may need to contain pressure to break all ties with Israel. Riyadh is likely to maintain a close relationship with Washington despite a chill in ties with Israel. The article also mentions the role of the United States in the region and its efforts to contain the crisis. Washington has deployed carriers in the Mediterranean to intimidate Hezbollah and Iran and has visited various countries to assure civilian protection. The article emphasizes the need to protect civilians in Gaza and calls for India to engage with both sides to encourage a ceasefire and dialogue.

The article argues that it was unrealistic to expect India's Supreme Court to legalize same-sex marriage, as history has shown that marriage equality usually takes several years to follow the decriminalization of queer sex. The author is relieved that the court did not "legislate" queer marriage, as they believe it should be the role of elected representatives rather than a select few jurists. They emphasize the need for collaborative efforts within the queer community to engage with those in power, advocate for their rights, and work towards law reform. The author criticizes the court for not going far enough in certain aspects, such as not recognizing discriminatory acts against queer live-in relationships as actionable claims. They also express concern about the implementation of the court's directives and highlight the importance of the state fulfilling its responsibilities to protect and prevent violence against queer people. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for data, advocacy, and collaboration within the queer community to drive progressive reform.

The article discusses the Women's Reservation Bill (WRB) in India and its significance in addressing gender inequality in politics. The author highlights the issue of caste, which is often overlooked in discussions about women's reservation. They question the Prime Minister's decision to postpone the implementation of the bill and criticize his claim of being chosen by God to empower women. The article also criticizes the patronizing language used in the legislation and raises concerns about the increase in violence against women during the current regime. 

The history of the WRB is explored, noting that it was first introduced in 1996 but has been held up for various reasons. Arguments for and against reservation for women are discussed, with some arguing that it violates the principle of equality while others believe it would empower women as a strong lobby. The article suggests that a shift in public opinion occurred in the 1980s and 1990s due to democratic upsurges and feminist issues gaining prominence. 

The opposition to the WRB is examined, with concerns raised about dominant caste women replacing non-dominant caste men if a blanket reservation of 33% is implemented. The article argues that this opposition reflects an ethical crisis within the political elite. The demand for "quotas within quotas" for OBC and Muslim women is also discussed, but it has been resisted by non-OBC parties.

Overall, the article raises important questions about the implementation and impact of women's reservation in Indian politics, particularly regarding caste dynamics and representation of marginalized groups.

The Supreme Court of India has ruled against granting constitutional validity to same-sex marriage, shifting the decision-making power to the legislature. However, the judgment recognizes the need for anti-discrimination laws and protections for the LGBTQIA+ community, as well as their right to choose a partner. While the verdict falls short of expanding individual rights and freedoms, it opens up room for progress. The court has accepted the government's proposal for an expert committee to address the concerns of the community, limiting its role to advisory. The judgment highlights the ongoing battles for equal rights and the long road ahead.

### [On marriage equality, the Supreme Court has lost a golden opportunity](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/on-marriage-equality-the-supreme-court-has-lost-a-golden-opportunity-8987709/)

The Supreme Court of India recently pronounced a judgment on same-sex marriage, addressing questions about the scope of marriage laws and civil rights for LGBTQ+ individuals. While the court rejected the government's opposition to examining these issues, it also stated that the right to marriage is not a fundamental right. However, it declared that the right to enter into a union is unrelated to sexual orientation and falls under fundamental rights in the Constitution. The court issued directions to authorities to prevent discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. There were differences of opinion among the judges, with some advocating for further rights for the community and others deferring to the legislature and executive. The article suggests that the court missed an opportunity to address this human problem and provide mechanisms for non-heterosexual couples to enjoy their civil rights without having to prove that the right to marriage is fundamental.

The article discusses two incidents of violence against marginalized communities in India. In the village of Khusrupur, a Dalit woman was subjected to humiliation and abuse because her husband had not paid a loan to a moneylender from the dominant OBC community. The incident received little attention from the mainstream media and there has been a lack of empathy from the political establishment, particularly the senior leadership of the Congress party. In contrast, a disturbing incident in Ujjain received widespread attention and was discussed by political leaders. The article criticizes the artificial distinction made between marginalized sections based on the ruling political party and state. It also highlights the historical lack of representation and support for socially and educationally backward communities by the Congress party. The article emphasizes the need for more progressive reforms and greater representation of marginalized communities in politics.

The Supreme Court of India recently made a judgment to protect same-sex unions from discrimination and grant them some legal rights. However, the Court stopped short of granting full recognition to same-sex marriage. The Chief Justice's judgment did not align with his colleagues and was not consistent with its own logic. While the Court acknowledged the values that protect individual dignity, it did not extend the provisions of the Special Marriage Act to same-sex unions. The Court argued that it could not invalidate or modify the act, but this position is odd considering the issue of discrimination. The Court also raised questions about societal consensus and whether courts should instigate moral change without backlash. The article suggests that using the Special Marriage Act to grant recognition to same-sex unions was a strategic move that leaves personal laws intact. However, by not recognizing same-sex marriage, society is denying a privileged social institution and relegating same-sex unions to a fugitive identity. The meaning of marriage has transformed, but its publicness and commitment remain central. Granting recognition to same-sex marriage would signal society's commitment to these values. Overall, the Court's judgment has not dispelled the notion that it does not cause discomfort to the executive branch.

### [Government’s demand from WhatsApp: Finetune the balance](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/governments-demand-from-whatsapp-finetune-the-balance-8986375/)

The central government in India is planning to send an order to Meta's WhatsApp, under Section 4(2) of the Information Technology Rules, 2021, to reveal the identities of individuals who first shared certain deepfake videos of politicians on the platform. While this is the first direct order to WhatsApp under this rule, it is not the first time WhatsApp has been asked to provide such details. The Tripura High Court recently stayed an order asking WhatsApp to disclose the originator of a chat containing a fake resignation of a Chief Minister. Under Section 4(2) of the IT Rules, social media intermediaries are required to identify the first originator of a message for specific purposes related to national security and public order. However, there are concerns about privacy and potential misuse by the government. Striking a careful balance between protecting citizens' rights and freedoms and preventing state arbitrariness is crucial.

### [On terror, India needs to make it clear to Canada that it must change](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/on-terror-india-needs-to-make-it-clear-to-canada-that-it-must-change-8986280/)

The recent statement by India accusing Canada of being a safe haven for terrorists, extremists, and organized crime has brought the issue of terrorism to the forefront. There are four dangerous trends in international terrorism that are currently occurring. Firstly, the global fight against terror is becoming increasingly fragmented after two decades of collective opposition. Secondly, Africa has seen a significant increase in terrorism, particularly in the Sahel region. Thirdly, terrorists are utilizing new and emerging technologies for their purposes, such as drones and online activities. Lastly, religiophobia is being politicized to justify acts of terror, with a selective focus on certain religions. Canada is seen as an example of this fragmentation, as it fails to recognize Khalistani terrorists on its soil as a threat. To address these trends and improve India-Canada relations, New Delhi must urge Canada to change its course of action.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi has declared India's interest in hosting the 2036 Olympics, stating that it is the country's "age-old dream" and the "aspiration of 140 crore Indians." Ahmedabad, known for having the world's biggest cricket stadium, is a potential candidate for hosting the event. However, hosting a successful Olympics requires winning the bid, putting on a good show, and achieving a respectable medal tally. The Games also provide an opportunity for cities to address long-standing issues and become more cosmopolitan and open-minded. Clean air and sustainability are important considerations, as seen in previous host cities like London, Rio, and Paris. Hosting the Olympics can also lead to reforms in sports administration and encourage investment in sports with high medal potential. India will need to improve its performance in order to lift national spirits and rank higher on the medals tally. Overall, preparing for this grand challenge begins now.

### [Sir Syed Ahmed Khan’s 125th birth anniversary: His record on women’s rights](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/sir-syed-ahmed-khans-125th-birth-anniversary-his-record-on-womens-rights-8986370/)

Sir Syed Ahmed Khan, known for his efforts in promoting modern education among Muslims, is criticized for not doing enough for women's education and for supporting colonial rulers. On his 125th birth anniversary, it is important to analyze his stance on women's social, educational, cultural, and religious emancipation. While Sir Syed had liberal values and established the Mohammedan Anglo-Oriental College at Aligarh, he held conservative views on women's education and believed in a tutor-based home education system. He argued that education jeopardized women's purpose of marriage and advocated for gender segregation and purdah-centric home education. He criticized co-education schools and institutions exclusively for girls, believing they caused public unrest against colonial rule. However, Sir Syed was also an advocate for women's empowerment and spoke out against practices such as female infanticide, polygamy, child marriage, sati, segregation of widows, and poverty-induced marriages. His views on women's education evolved after interacting with women in Europe during his visit to England in 1869-70. He recognized the importance of women's education in the progress of society but still supported home-tutor-based education for women.

### [India’s economy, on the upswing](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/indias-economy-on-the-upswing-8986350/)

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has upgraded India's GDP growth forecast for 2023-24 to 6.3%, a 40 basis point increase from its previous forecast in April. The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) forecast remains unchanged at 6.5%. However, the article suggests that the Indian economy could grow at a faster pace than expected, with a projected growth rate of 6.7% for the full year. The article highlights several reasons for this optimism, including the even spatial distribution of rainfall during the monsoon season, continued capital expenditure by states and the central government, robust new company registrations, and strong credit growth in the banking sector. The article also dismisses concerns about unsecured loans and household debt, stating that there is nothing to be alarmed about these trends. Overall, the sustained healthy credit growth is expected to propel economic momentum in India and contribute to sustained growth in the future.

### [Abortion of 26-week-old foetus: Not just nine months](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/abortion-of-26-week-old-foetus-not-just-nine-months-8986212/)

The article discusses the recent amendment to India's Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act, which revised the upper gestational limit for legal abortion to 24 weeks for certain categories of "vulnerable women." The amendment was made in response to several writ petitions seeking judicial authorization for termination of pregnancy. However, even after the amendment, women continue to approach the courts in cases where the new gestational limits are breached or abortion care is denied by providers. The article highlights that many women seek late-term abortions for various reasons, including structural barriers to accessing early-stage abortions and changes in circumstances post-pregnancy. It also mentions that fear of criminal prosecution often deters medical practitioners from providing abortion care, leading women to turn to the courts as a last resort. The article criticizes the current law for not reflecting international human rights standards and best practices on abortion and emphasizes the need for decriminalization and removal of grounds-based regulation and gestational limits. It references a landmark Supreme Court decision that acknowledged the provider-centric nature of the MTP Act and the need for women to approach courts or seek unsafe abortions when denied services. The article concludes by highlighting the disproportionate impact of grounds-based regulation and gestational limits during court hearings and questions whether some reasons for seeking abortion are considered more valid than others.

### [Rabindranath Tagore’s thoughts on Israel, the Jewish Question – and how he differed from Gandhi and Nehru](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rabindranath-tagore-israel-jewish-question-palestine-8985662/)

Rabindranath Tagore, a prominent Indian writer and thinker, expressed his views on the Jewish-Palestinian problem and Zionism in the early 20th century. He initially supported the spiritual side of Zionism but later realized that British imperialism was exacerbating the complexities of the issue. Tagore believed that the Palestine problem could only be solved through direct understanding between Arabs and Jews, without the intervention of a third party. He emphasized the importance of including Arabs in Jewish political and economic programs and proposed a joint Palestine Commonwealth government. Tagore's ideas anticipated the consociational theory of democracy and emphasized accommodative unity within diversity. He condemned racism and sectarianism and criticized the atrocities against Jews in Germany. While Gandhi and Congress did not support the Jewish demand for a separate homeland, Tagore believed that both communities could live together and contribute to a new era in Palestine. He closely followed the progress of Jewish establishments in Palestine and sent representatives to study their work.

### [In late stage pregnancy termination, don’t overlook the woman’s safety](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/late-stage-pregnancy-termination-dont-overlook-the-womans-safety-8985244/)

The article discusses the recent amendment to the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Act in India and the government's approach to balancing the pro-life and pro-choice debate. The amendment aims to provide women, regardless of their marital status, with access to safe abortion within the legally allowed time frame while ensuring dignity, autonomy, confidentiality, and justice.

Unsafe abortions have been a significant concern in India, with a high number of deaths and complications resulting from such practices. Approximately 44% of pregnancies in India are unintended, and around 16 million unintended pregnancies lead to abortions each year. Out of these, about 800,000 are unsafe abortions, and 10% of them result in maternal deaths. The amendment seeks to address these issues and align with Sustainable Development Goal 3.1, which aims to reduce maternal mortality.

The ongoing case in the Supreme Court regarding a woman's right to terminate a pregnancy after 20 weeks has sparked discussions about the MTP Act. The article emphasizes that the decision to have an abortion is never easy and acknowledges the emotional, mental, and physical impact it can have. However, the right to life and liberty enshrined in the Indian Constitution also covers women's reproductive choices. The amended law extends the safe abortion period from 12 weeks to 20 weeks and allows unmarried women to undergo safe abortions, protecting them from untrained practitioners and unsafe clinics.

The amendment also permits abortions between 20 and 24 weeks under special circumstances, requiring approval from a medical board for pregnancies that have exceeded the safe period of 24 weeks. Nevertheless, the article highlights the importance of considering medical safety in late-term terminations, as the procedure becomes more complex and poses risks to the mother's health.

The article mentions that after speaking to doctors in the field, it is generally agreed that the foetus becomes more difficult to expel once its bones are formed, posing risks to the mother. While some advanced medical units believe that foetus viability is high after 28 weeks, many doctors are cautious about terminating pregnancies after 24 weeks unless there are strong reasons. This does not diminish a woman's agency in making her choice but ensures that decisions are informed and nuanced, with additional administrative and medical provisions after a certain safe period.

The article concludes by highlighting the significance of treating life as precious, acknowledging the development of the foetus at a certain point and the potential for survival in neonatal care units. The current MTP Act is seen as a balanced approach between being pro-life and pro-choice.

The article discusses two recent events that have implications for India and require introspection. The first event is the Bihar caste survey results, which highlight the absence of social and economic equality in Indian society. The second event is the killing of innocent civilians in Israel, which raises questions about the use of force and the denial of Palestinian statehood. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding and following the advice of B R Ambedkar and Sardar Patel, who emphasized the need for social democracy and minority protection. It calls for acknowledging and addressing social inequalities in India through measures such as a national caste census. Additionally, it criticizes Israel for denying the existence of a Palestinian state and using force to subdue violence, while urging the global community to support a two-state solution.

India's political class is realizing the importance of the Middle East for the country's economic prosperity and national security. The domestic politics surrounding the recent attack on southern Israel have overshadowed the international crisis. Congress has been accused of being soft on terror, while the BJP has been criticized for diluting India's support for Palestine. However, both parties must prioritize abiding principles and clear-eyed interests when it comes to terrorism. India rejects the notion that resolving the root cause is necessary to end terrorism. Congress must clearly articulate that terror cannot be used as a bargaining chip, while the BJP must avoid turning solidarity with Israel into minority-baiting at home. Insulating domestic politics from the turmoil in the Middle East is crucial for India's interests. As the crisis escalates, India should urge Israel to respect humanitarian laws and work with Arab partners to secure the release of Israeli hostages held by Hamas. India needs to actively join international efforts to prevent a catastrophe in the Middle East and engage in regular consultations with opposition parties to forge a consensus on dealing with its consequences.

### [The message from Sikkim: Heed the water’s warning](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-message-from-sikkim-heed-the-waters-warning-8984607/)

The article discusses the recent glacial lake outburst flood (GLOF) in Sikkim, India, which caused significant damage to infrastructure and loss of life. The exact cause of the flood is still unknown, but hypotheses include intense rainfall, landslides, avalanches, or earthquakes. Glacial lakes are forming more frequently due to increased glacier melting caused by global warming. These lakes have loose embankments that can fail if water levels rise rapidly or if a portion of the glacier falls into the lake. The article highlights the vulnerability of High Mountain Asia to GLOFs and calls for increased monitoring and risk reduction strategies. It also emphasizes the need for comprehensive studies on glaciers in the Himalayan region to understand their response to climate change.

### [In Bihar, an attempt to address the mental health needs of teachers](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/in-bihar-an-attempt-to-address-the-mental-health-needs-of-teachers-8984633/)

The government of Bihar in India is conducting a mental health survey for over four lakh teachers in government schools. The survey aims to understand the stress levels of teachers, their ability to complete the syllabus on time, and how stress impacts their teaching. This initiative comes in response to complaints about teacher absenteeism, inability to teach the syllabus, and reports of corporal punishment. Teachers have cited non-teaching assignments like election duty and the management of the midday meal scheme as factors that hinder their primary duties. Addressing these concerns will help teachers perform their job of nurturing young minds effectively. The survey is seen as an important step towards relieving some of the pressure faced by teachers and improving education quality in Bihar.

### [India needs more doctors — and how it can happen](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-needs-more-doctors-and-how-it-can-happen-8984590/)

The demand for doctors in India is higher than the supply, and there is also a shortage of medical education seats. Despite efforts to expand medical colleges and seats, the number of medical graduates per population in India is still lower compared to other countries like China, Israel, the US, and the UK. The small size of medical colleges in India is a barrier to increasing the supply of doctors, and regulatory and financial constraints contribute to this issue. Both public and private colleges face scalability constraints, with teaching faculty shortages. Lowering costs will require regulatory reform and integrating innovation and technology into curriculum design. The competency-based curriculum in India aims to maintain the quality of doctors but limits scalability. The US has implemented innovations like using practicing MD doctors as mentors and integrating interprofessional education to improve quality and resource utilization. While there is a perceived trade-off between quality and scale, there are concerns about equity. The government's focus on evenly distributed production of doctors may not lead to efficient production due to inter-state migration. The policy focus should address barriers to scale and incentivize migration to low-availability areas.

### [Ashok Gulati writes: How India can minimise climate risk in agriculture](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ashok-gulati-writes-how-india-can-minimise-climate-risk-in-agriculture-8984596/)

The article discusses India's progress in achieving food security and its use of water resources in agriculture. India has made significant strides in food production, with exports of cereals and increased milk, poultry, and fishery production. However, access to nutritious food remains a challenge, with a significant portion of the population malnourished or underweight. In terms of water resources, India has limited freshwater availability despite its large population. The country needs to adopt a two-pronged strategy for water in agriculture, focusing on supply-side measures like reservoir stocking and groundwater recharge, as well as demand-side measures like rational allocation and efficient use of water. The article suggests shifting focus from land productivity to water productivity and incentivizing farmers to switch to less water-intensive crops. Efficient water use is crucial for sustainable food security in India.

Prime Minister Indira Gandhi has condemned the recent wave of violence and terrorism in India, stating that violence will not solve any problems. She expressed concern over acts of terrorism, extremists' activities, and the killing of innocent people in Punjab and the capital. A hand grenade attack during a Ramlila function in Chandigarh resulted in three deaths and 24 injuries. Mrs. Gandhi also made it clear that India will not accept refugees from Sri Lanka due to the country's inability to accommodate millions of refugees. Additionally, Pakistan is set to receive four Hawkeye radar surveillance and command and control aircraft from the United States, which were previously used by Israel over Lebanon.

### [To liberals against a caste census — India deserves better](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/dont-count-they-say-8984587/)

The article discusses the publication of caste survey data by the Bihar government, which provides a reliable snapshot of the caste makeup of Indian society. Supporters predict that this information could cause a political earthquake, while critics raise concerns about the potential fallout. The BJP fears that the numbers could disrupt their winning caste coalition, while some liberals oppose the publication of the data due to fears of social justice becoming misguided. The article argues that liberals should support the caste census as it can provide evidence of caste inequalities and fortify their argument for greater equality. Critics reduce social justice to just reservation, ignoring the larger problem of caste inequality. The article also addresses fears of caste politics and the consolidation of caste identities if the census data is released. It argues that not collecting data on castes has not prevented politics from being influenced by caste lines, and releasing the data would not change this fact but would shed light on it. The article concludes by discussing fears of caste majoritarianism and argues that a politics seeking to address caste injustice can also subscribe to liberal values and avoid becoming tyrannical. It calls for a better liberalism in India that embraces social justice as an ally rather than rebuking it.

The author notes that this statement reflects Modi's tendency to connect the aspirations of the Indian people with larger events and projects. The article also mentions other upcoming plans by Modi and his party, such as landing on the Moon, passing the women's reservation bill, and inaugurating the Ram Mandir temple in Ayodhya. The opposition parties are challenged to present their demand for a caste census in a way that promotes social justice for all and counters the BJP's Hindutva ideology. The author emphasizes the need for the opposition to create a shared sense of belonging among voters and present their own aggregative ideas.

The article discusses the recent Netflix spy thriller "Khufiya" and its ambitious attempts to engage with both personal and geopolitical themes. The film explores the correlation between personal transparency and global violence, as well as reverses gender roles in the thriller genre. However, the article argues that the film falls short in delivering meaningful insights, relying on familiar platitudes instead. It also examines how the film assumes an audience with absolute knowledge, trained to not take appearances for granted. The protagonist's unconventional sexuality is a central theme, highlighting the unrepresentable nature of both inner and outer domains. The article also discusses Tabu's role as the star and how she provides stability in moments of chaos. Overall, "Khufiya" is seen as an experiment in bringing mainstream genres closer to middlebrow films while exploring the role of platforms like Netflix in shaping viewer-subjects. However, it ultimately falls back on the intellectually satisfying realism of unrepresentability.

### [Her body, her choice: Why a woman’s right to terminate her pregnancy must be upheld](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/her-body-her-choice-woman-terminate-pregnancy-upheld-8983912/)

This article discusses a case in which a 27-year-old married woman sought permission from the Supreme Court to terminate her unplanned and unwanted pregnancy. The woman was already a mother of two young children and was not mentally prepared for a third child. She faced difficulties finding healthcare providers willing to perform the abortion due to being 20 weeks pregnant. The Supreme Court initially granted permission for the abortion, but concerns about the fetus' viability led to the case being referred back to a medical board. The article argues that the decision to terminate a pregnancy should be in the hands of the pregnant woman and highlights inconsistencies in court decisions regarding abortion permission. It questions why it is deemed safe to end a pregnancy due to fetal anomaly after 24 weeks but not an unwanted pregnancy that affects the mental health of the pregnant person. The article emphasizes the importance of ensuring safe, legal, affordable, and accessible abortion services without causing additional hardship for pregnant individuals.

Kumar recently apologized for promoting a tobacco brand after facing backlash on Twitter, while Devgn defended the ad, stating that promoting such products is a personal choice. The article argues that adults should be able to choose their vices and questions the ban on advertising legal products. It suggests that celebrities are used in these ads to gain credibility due to the existing ban on direct tobacco advertisements. The article also criticizes society's tendency to blame stars for promoting harmful substances and argues that the government prioritizes profit gains from taxing tobacco over public health. It concludes by discussing the complexities of ethical issues and the need for deeper thought rather than judgment when considering contradictory situations.

### [P Chidambaram writes: A test for Congress and BJP](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/assembly-elections-in-five-states-eci-congress-bjp-8983265/)

The Election Commission announced the schedule of elections in five states, putting an end to speculation about Prime Minister Narendra Modi playing the One Nation One Election card. The author believes that the upcoming elections in these states will be a test of strength between the BJP and Congress, as the NDA no longer exists after the exit of significant political parties. In Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Rajasthan, the contest is between Congress and BJP, while Telangana has a third player, BRS. Mizoram sees a four-way contest involving regional parties and Congress, with BJP not being a major player. The BJP has already announced candidates and is relying on Modi's presence, multiple rallies, and financial resources. On the other hand, Congress has not released any candidate list yet but will go into elections with a 'CM face'. The author notes that in the 2018 elections, BJP lost in all five states. The prospects of each party in each state need to be assessed separately. The author cautiously predicts that Congress may return to power in Chhattisgarh and Rajasthan, while Madhya Pradesh may see a change due to defections by BJP. Telangana may witness a contest between BRS and Congress, while Mizoram could result in another coalition government.

The upcoming electoral contest in Rajasthan is expected to be close, according to Congress leader Rahul Gandhi. This article reflects on the 1967 general elections in India, which saw non-Congress governments come into power in several states. The incumbent Congress chief minister in Rajasthan, Mohanlal Sukhadia, was unable to secure a majority in the state legislature. The governor's decision to invite Sukhadia to form the government received criticism from opposition parties, leading to protests and violence. Eventually, President's rule was imposed in Rajasthan before Sukhadia formed the government with support from other parties. These events had a national impact, with a no-confidence motion being pressed against Prime Minister Indira Gandhi. The article concludes by highlighting the recurring themes of partisan governors, sequestering of MLAs, and engineering defections in Indian politics since 1967.

The article criticizes the marketing campaign for being insensitive towards Pakistani fans and perpetuating an unsporting spirit. It concludes by expressing disappointment that fans will be deprived of the joy of egging their teams on in the stadium named after the Indian prime minister.

### [Why Israel has already lost the conflict with Hamas](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/israel-lost-conflict-with-hamas-8982778/)

The recent events in southern Israel involved a strategic surprise attack by Hamas militants. Israel's response has been to unite and quickly eliminate the militants. The IDF's objective is to not only destroy Hamas' military capacity but also its ability to govern Gaza. However, this raises questions about who will govern Gaza if Hamas is no longer in power. Israel's military superiority does not guarantee a quick peace and the absence of Hamas due to various factors such as Gaza's small size, population demographics, and accessibility to weapons. A ground assault on Gaza is likely, but the final objectives and victory conditions are complicated. Unlike other cities in warfare history, Gaza is densely populated with no opportunity for escape when fighting reaches the streets. The population largely supports or sympathizes with Hamas and can provide critical support functions during an Israeli ground operation. Expect grueling urban combat with a motivated civilian population. Given these circumstances, it would be impossible for Israel to occupy Gaza without causing a bloodbath and disregarding the civilians. Instead, expect devastation from air attacks and Israeli ground incursions targeting specific areas of interest before withdrawing. This attack aims to restart another cycle of violence between Israelis and Palestinians and prevent peace overtures from gaining momentum. Hamas' true aim is to generate a forever-war and maintain their relevance and power. It is unlikely that a sustainable peace can be achieved after any form of military operation by Israel, making the world an even more dangerous place.

### [Why, as a cricket fan, the ODI World Cup does not excite me](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/cricket-fan-odi-world-cup-excite-me-8982507/)

The author of the article expresses their lack of excitement and surprise for the ongoing ODI World Cup in India. They attribute their apathy to a few fundamental problems with ODIs and international cricket. The rise of T20 matches has overshadowed ODIs, with Test matches still receiving unconditional love from traditionalists. T20s, with their fast-paced action, cater to shorter attention spans and attract younger fans. ODIs, however, fall in the middle ground and fail to captivate viewers. The author suggests that removing the uneventful middle overs would essentially create a T20 game. The lack of competitive balance in big tournaments, such as the World Cup, and the political tensions surrounding cricket in India also contribute to the author's disinterest in the event. Despite still watching some matches, they do not have the same level of anticipation as in previous years.

### [Methodology of Global Hunger Index has been rightly criticised. But conversation must go on](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/methodology-of-global-hunger-index-has-been-rightly-criticised-but-conversation-must-go-on-8982008/)

The Global Hunger Index (GHI) report ranks India 111 out of 125 nations, which has led to criticism from the Union Ministry of Women and Child Development. The ministry argues that the GHI is flawed because it focuses on child health and uses a small sample size for estimating undernourishment. While these criticisms may be valid, policymakers should not overlook the issue of poor food intake in India. Despite initiatives like the National Food Security Act and Poshan 2.0, many people still struggle to access basic cereals and grains due to technical issues, bureaucracy, inequality, and gender discrimination. The National Family Health Survey reveals that a large percentage of children do not receive a minimum acceptable diet, and there are high rates of anemia among various groups. Scholars have emphasized the need to address vitamin and micro-nutrient deficiency and empower women in nutrition discussions. Additionally, more detailed data on household consumption is necessary, as official estimates on per capita household spending have not been available for over 10 years. While it is important to critique the GHI, the government must also prioritize addressing the nutrition challenge by improving its information repositories.

### [Claudia Goldin’s quiet revolution: How she helped feminise economic enquiry](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/claudia-goldins-quiet-revolution-how-she-helped-feminise-economic-enquiry-8981975/)

Professor Claudia Goldin, the first woman to be tenured at Harvard University's Economics Department and the third woman to receive the Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences, has been celebrated for her contributions to understanding the pay gap, gender-blind recruitment, and other issues related to women's economic empowerment. One of her key insights is the concept of "quiet revolutions" in the labor market, which refers to inter-generational changes in women's attitudes towards education and employment. Goldin argues that a cognitive shift occurred when American women started working for personal fulfillment rather than solely for financial reasons. She also emphasizes the importance of deep, interdisciplinary descriptive data in understanding economic well-being and transformation. While her work primarily focuses on women in the US labor market, it offers valuable insights into long-term social change and challenges traditional views on economic growth and women's labor force participation. Critics argue that her work is limited by its neo-classical frameworks and focus on highly educated women in the West, but Goldin's emphasis on centering women's experiences in economic research is seen as a significant contribution to feminist economics.

### [Ram Madhav writes: Years after Ambedkar embraced Buddhism, a Hinduism still stuck in its ways](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/ram-madhav-writes-years-after-ambedkar-embraced-buddhism-a-hinduism-still-stuck-in-its-ways-8981986/)

This article discusses the decision made by B R Ambedkar, the architect of the Indian Constitution and leader of the Depressed Classes, to renounce Hinduism and convert to Buddhism. The conversion took place on October 14, 1956, just seven weeks before Ambedkar's death. A Buddhist monk from Burma initiated Ambedkar, his wife, and many others into Buddhism at a ceremony in Nagpur. This event is now recognized as Deekshabhoomi and is a significant pilgrimage site for neo-Buddhists.

Ambedkar's decision to convert was the culmination of a vow he made 21 years earlier. In 1935, he declared that he would not die as a Hindu due to the humiliating conditions imposed by the religion. The article also highlights the ideological differences between Ambedkar and Mahatma Gandhi regarding varna (caste) and jati (caste system) in Hinduism. Despite Gandhi's efforts to integrate the Depressed Classes into Hindu society through political means, Ambedkar believed that true freedom for untouchables could only be achieved by leaving Hinduism.

Ambedkar's opposition to Gandhi stemmed from his belief that political power was crucial for securing the rights of the Depressed Classes. He saw Gandhi as a formidable force against their progress. Additionally, Ambedkar wrote a book called "Annihilation of Caste" in 1936, which criticized the caste system and called for its destruction. He argued that inter-caste dining or marriages were not enough to overcome caste because it was deeply ingrained in people's mindsets.

The article concludes by emphasizing the relevance of Ambedkar's journey from the Poona Pact (an agreement between Gandhi and Ambedkar) to his conversion to Buddhism at Deekshabhoomi. It suggests that despite some progress in rejecting caste, India continues to fortify these institutions for political expediency or religious orthodoxy.

It mentions that while there may be some changes due to the change in leadership in Maldives, the fundamentals of the relationship are unlikely to be altered. The article also mentions the challenges faced by Maldives, including issues with democratic governance, drug abuse, growing inequality, and religious extremism. It emphasizes India's role in assisting Maldives in times of need, such as during crises and providing security assistance. The article also raises concerns about China's interference in Maldives' internal politics and its debt financing leading to potential hegemony. It concludes by stating that it is expected the new president of Maldives will not take drastic measures that would harm relations with India, as undermining this relationship could have repercussions for Maldives.

### [Israel’s people are going through a crisis — and they do not trust their leaders to deal with it](https://indianexpress.com/article/columns/israels-people-are-going-through-a-crisis-and-they-do-not-trust-their-leaders-to-deal-with-it-8981973/)

The article discusses the recent attacks on Israel, which are being described as the worst since the Holocaust. Over 1,300 people have died, including ordinary citizens caught off guard in their homes and kibbutzim in southern Israel. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad militants have surrounded Israeli homes and taken captives into Gaza. The militants have also taken dead bodies of Israeli soldiers to use as leverage against Israel. Foreign agricultural workers from the Philippines, Thailand, and Mexico have been captured, and some have been killed. The Israeli army has fought militants in residential areas for five days, resulting in a large number of militant casualties. Many Israeli families are searching for missing loved ones, while the army has called all reserve forces for a massive operation over Gaza. The article suggests that the current government ignored warnings from the defense minister about political divisions within the country that were impacting national security. The author argues that strong leaders like Benjamin Netanyahu can risk the lives of their people with their delusions and trickery. The article concludes by stating that politics is the spoiler in resolving the conflict between Israel and Palestine.

### [Food inflation isn’t across-the-board. It calls for a more nuanced approach](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/food-inflation-isnt-across-the-board-it-calls-for-a-more-nuanced-approach-8981997/)

Consumer price inflation in India has dropped from 7.4% to 5% year-on-year between July and September, falling below the Reserve Bank of India's upper tolerance limit of 6%. This decrease is largely due to a decline in retail food inflation, which has dropped from 11.5% to 6.6% during the same period. The decrease in food inflation is mainly concentrated in cereals and pulses, while prices for vegetables and milk have moderated significantly. Tomato prices, in particular, have seen a drastic decrease in inflation from 202.1% in July to -21.5% in September. Edible oil inflation has remained low or negative for over a year. While it is too early to say if the worst is over, the impact of El Niño has not been as severe as feared. Despite concerns over dry weather and high temperatures in August, September saw rainfall that was 13.2% above average, providing relief for crops and reducing water deficits in reservoirs. This should help keep food prices stable for now. However, the government's approach to controlling prices through export bans/restrictions and stocking limits may not be sustainable in the long term. Balancing consumer and producer interests is crucial, especially considering the upcoming elections where farm votes matter. Additionally, pro-consumer policies may hinder investments in a sector with high employment potential.

Karthyayani Amma, who topped Kerala's Aksharalaksham literacy program at the age of 96, passed away at the age of 101. Despite her success, she had wanted to clear her Class X exams and her drive serves as a model of individual aspiration and institutional support. The gender gap in education in India remains large, with lower literacy rates for women in rural areas compared to urban areas. Adult literacy programs have helped improve literacy rates among rural women, with Kerala being a role model in this regard. Karthyayani Amma's success story highlights the importance of individual determination and the right to education without constraints.

India celebrated its 74th Republic Day earlier this year, highlighting its status as the current president of the G20. India's leadership role in the G20 reflects its increasing importance and influence in global politics. Despite social, cultural, economic, and regional complexities, India has successfully built a multi-party democratic political system and conducted free and fair elections. Over the years, there has been an increase in voter turnout and the participation of women voters and elected women representatives. India's democratic discourse is characterized by a competitive electoral landscape with diverse political parties. As a nation committed to democracy and multilateralism, India's G20 Presidency provides an opportunity to showcase its diversity, culture, democracy, development, and technological transformation to the global community. The G20 Summit has resulted in outcomes such as economic growth, tourism expansion, food security improvement through millet production, biofuel commitment, and important agreements like the India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor Agreement and the Global Biofuels Alliance. The P20 Summit, organized by Parliament, will focus on sustainable development goals, sustainable energy transition, gender equality, and public digital platforms. It will also emphasize environmentally conscious lifestyles through the "LiFE is Beautiful" initiative.

The article argues in favor of conducting a caste census in India. It states that there are five considerations for endorsing or opposing such an investigation: the existence of a problem or condition, relevance to the condition, feasibility, affordability, and risk. The article asserts that caste appears to be an issue in Indian society and therefore merits investigation. It explains that a caste census would provide multi-dimensional information about each caste's population, education, occupation, and socio-economic profile, which is necessary for reducing social inequality and fine-tuning reservation policies. The article also addresses concerns about the potential accentuation of caste consciousness and cleavages, suggesting ways to mitigate this side effect. It criticizes arguments against conducting a caste census as illogical and suggests that it is necessary to break the entrenched privilege associated with caste.

The article discusses the issue of discrimination in job and education applications and whether it is an effective policy tool for achieving equality. The author argues that expanding reservation policies, which discriminate in favor of certain groups, is unfair to future generations and divisive. Instead, the author suggests rebooting India's infrastructure of opportunity, employment, employability, and education as a powerful alternative to reservation policies. This would involve making discrimination based on caste, gender, and religion illegal while focusing on equal treatment, unbiased competition, and impartially judged outcomes. The author also proposes three low-hanging fruits for improving education, employability, and employment: fixing government schools by addressing performance management and governance issues, attracting financing for skills development from employers through redesigning the system, and cutting regulatory burdens for employers to encourage job creation. The article concludes by advocating for a simultaneous pursuit of justice, equality, and excellence in order to reach 100 years of Independence with 100% reservation for all people.

The article highlights the increasing suppression of journalists and writers in India, with examples such as Arundhati Roy facing prosecution for statements made years ago and raids on the residences of professionals associated with a news portal. The government is accused of creating an information drought by withholding data and being secretive about its agenda. The lack of transparency extends to crucial issues like Covid-19 deaths, migrant worker conditions, farmer deaths during protests, and mob violence incidents. The government's fear of numbers and evasion of data is criticized, particularly in relation to welfare eligibility and the exclusion of a significant population from essential schemes. The delay in conducting the Census and the lack of available data are described as both an administrative crisis and a humanitarian issue. The government's admission of not having data on various subjects is highlighted, along with the need for universal access to information.

The article discusses the Palestine-Israel relationship and warns against interpreting human histories through the lens of religious imagination. It highlights the dangers of colonial ideas about identity and community, as well as the fiction of one group's superiority over others. The history of the Promised Land is complex, with shifting narratives about borders and mythic memories. Historians suggest that even Jewish sources have differing accounts of the boundaries of the territory promised by God. The article also explores the entangled lineages of holy personages in the region and questions exclusive claims to territory based on biblical ancestry. It discusses how Zionism, colonialism, and western powers played a role in creating an exclusive Jewish identity and claiming ownership of the land. The establishment of Israel resulted in Arab displacement and ongoing violence. The article argues that attempts to establish a national identity based on a "pure" identity have not led to lasting solutions but rather more bloodshed. It concludes by drawing parallels between Indian and Middle Eastern modernities and warns against constraining multiple identities in favor of a monolithic one through force.

The latest periodic labour force survey for 2022-23 reveals some interesting trends in the Indian job market. The survey shows that the labour force participation rate has increased, indicating an improvement in the labour market. However, it also highlights a decline in regular wage/salaried employment and a rise in self-employment. The increase in participation rates is more significant in rural areas, particularly among females. Some suggest that this rise in participation is driven by economic distress in rural areas, pushing women to work to supplement their family incomes. The share of self-employed individuals has also increased, while the share of regular wage/salaried employed has decreased. Additionally, the percentage of workers engaged in informal sector enterprises has gone up. Although unemployment rates have declined overall, these trends raise concerns about the economy's ability to generate sufficient productive and well-paying jobs for the growing number of people entering the labour force each year. Inadequate job creation remains a major challenge for policymakers.

A recent study on frogs published in the Royal Society Open Science journal suggests that Disney's animated films, such as Snow White and The Princess and the Frog, could have benefited from this research. The study reveals that female European common frogs "play dead" to avoid eager males during mating season, challenging long-held beliefs about the nature of female frogs and the aggression of their male counterparts. This finding raises questions about the portrayal of frogs in Disney movies and other influential stories, where assumptions about gender roles are embedded. There have been attempts to retell these stories in a more realistic and equal manner, where characters have agency rather than perpetuating inequalities.

California Governor Gavin Newsom has vetoed Senate Bill 403 (SB403), a controversial caste bill introduced by State Senator Aisha Wahab. The bill, which aimed to address caste discrimination, faced opposition and criticism from various groups. The article highlights the larger context of discussions on racism, Zionism, and Hindutva in relation to the anti-caste movement. It mentions the internationalization of caste as a global problem similar to race, with India and Israel being accused of apartheid due to the caste system and Zionism respectively. The article also discusses a high-profile case of alleged caste discrimination at Cisco, which was dismissed in 2023. The author argues that the anti-caste movement has been marked by differences in class, caste, generational location, and social capital within the Indian-American community. They criticize the media and academia for failing to provide diverse perspectives on the issue and accuse them of endorsing propaganda rather than promoting debate and truth-seeking. The article suggests that there is a need for an honest reappraisal of how anti-Semitism and Hinduphobia have been normalized under the guise of anti-Zionist and anti-Hindutva or anti-caste movements. The author concludes by stating that lies and propaganda can lead to genocides and calls for a veto on such falsehoods.

The article discusses the controversies surrounding the Nobel Prize and calls for more transparency in the nomination process. It highlights the lack of diversity among Nobel laureates, particularly in fields like literature, medicine, and physics. The author argues that making the nomination process public and revealing past nominees and nominations would provide much-needed context and shed light on the diversity numbers. Additionally, the article suggests breaking convention and awarding the science prizes to organizations rather than individuals, as scientific discoveries often involve large collaborations. The author concludes by urging the Nobel Foundation to address these issues before more criticism arises.

The article then delves into the privileges and immunities granted to MPs and MLAs under Articles 105 and 194 of the Indian Constitution. It mentions a Supreme Court case involving bribery during a no-confidence motion, where MPs who took bribes and voted were protected under Article 105, while those who took bribes but did not vote were prosecuted. The article explores the balance between an MP's right to free speech within Parliament and a citizen's right to free speech outside Parliament. It also discusses previous Supreme Court cases that upheld the privileges enjoyed by MPs/MLAs in terms of free speech and publication. The article mentions a recent case before the Supreme Court regarding whether legislators enjoy immunity from prosecution for accepting bribes to vote in Parliament or an Assembly.

World Heart Day, observed on September 29, aims to raise awareness about cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and promote heart-healthy lifestyles. However, this year there was a lack of meaningful campaign by public health agencies in India. Instead, English-language national dailies carried advertorials sponsored by the diagnostics, devices, and pharma industries. Recent surveys have shown low levels of awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in India, with a significant gap between awareness and treatment. Only 28% of those with hypertension were aware of it, and among those aware, only 52% were being treated. The surveys also revealed disparities in access to healthcare based on education level, income, and geographic location. The National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) launched in 2010 has focused on screening and treatment but more resources are needed for primary healthcare interventions. Additionally, a risk factor approach to controlling CVD should be complemented with addressing socioeconomic influences on health inequities.

However, this economic growth has led to increased energy consumption, primarily from fossil fuels, which contributes to global warming. To combat this, there is a global consensus to achieve net-zero emissions by 2045-2070. India faces a unique challenge as it needs to increase per capita energy use while transitioning to net-zero emissions. The country aspires to reach a Human Development Index comparable to advanced countries, which requires a minimum energy consumption of 2,400 kilogram oil equivalent (kgoe) per capita per year. Even with improvements in energy efficiency, India would still need around 25,000-30,000 TWhr/yr of clean energy to support its development. While renewable energy sources like solar and wind are being deployed rapidly, they alone cannot meet the demand. Nuclear energy is seen as a viable option due to its cleanliness and safety. Scaling up nuclear energy would require shedding unfounded fears and implementing an effective policy framework. A six-pronged national strategy for nuclear energy includes using indigenous pressurized heavy water reactors (PHWRs) for base load electrical capacity addition, building small modular reactors (SMRs) at retiring coal plant sites, offering partially owned captive units for energy-intensive industries, developing high-temperature reactors for hydrogen production, advancing the thorium-based nuclear power program, and promoting rapid deployment of new nuclear-energy capacity in emerging economies. Achieving the necessary increase in energy production will require a compound annual growth rate of around 4.8%, with significant reliance on nuclear energy. This can be achieved through bold policy support that provides equal opportunities for both nuclear and renewable energy sources.

### [For cricket in Olympics, a lot needs to fall in place](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/cricket-olympics-lot-fall-in-place-8978896/)

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) is considering including T20 cricket in the Olympic programme for the Los Angeles Games in 2028. The T20 format is seen as a good fit for the Olympics' time constraints, unlike longer formats such as Tests and 50-over matches. However, there are challenges to overcome, including educating IOC members and a global audience about the sport. The ICC will need to take on the responsibility of promoting cricket, with India likely to support its inclusion. Additionally, weather conditions and rain delays pose a significant challenge for cricket in the Olympics, requiring reserve days to be scheduled. Overall, while there is interest in bringing cricket to the Olympics, it will require significant effort before it can become a reality.

### [Indians struggle with high blood pressure. And it’s not about lifestyle](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/world-heart-day-health-lifestyle-inequalities-cardiovascular-awareness-8979090/)

World Heart Day, observed on September 29, aims to raise awareness about cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and promote heart-healthy lifestyles. However, this year there was a lack of meaningful campaign by public health agencies in India. Instead, English-language national dailies carried advertorials sponsored by the diagnostics, devices, and pharma industries. Recent surveys have shown low levels of awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in India, with a significant gap between awareness and treatment. Only 28% of those with hypertension were aware of it, and among those aware, only 52% were being treated. The surveys also revealed disparities in access to healthcare based on education level, income, and geographic location. The National Programme for Prevention and Control of Cancer, Diabetes, Cardiovascular Diseases and Stroke (NPCDCS) launched in 2010 has focused on screening and treatment but more resources are needed for primary healthcare interventions. Additionally, a risk factor approach to controlling CVD should be complemented with addressing socioeconomic influences on health inequities.

### [Nobel Laureate Claudia Goldin punctures myth that economic growth reduces gender differences in labour market](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/nobel-laureate-claudia-goldin-punctures-myth-economic-growth-reduces-gender-differences-labour-market-8978887/)

Claudia Goldin, a professor at Harvard University, has won the Nobel prize in economics for her research on women's earnings and labor market participation throughout history. Her work debunked the misconception that economic growth automatically leads to increased female participation in the workforce. Goldin found a "U-shaped" relationship between the number of women in paid employment and the US economy's growth, with women's engagement initially decreasing during the transition from agrarian to industrial economies and then increasing with rising education levels, scientific advancements, and evolving social norms. Despite progress, the proportion of women in paid work remains lower than men, and they often earn less. The article emphasizes the need for developing countries like India to address this issue due to its injustice and inefficiency in not utilizing the best woman for the job.

This article reflects on a personal experience in Jerusalem during the Feast of Tabernacles, a Jewish festival that commemorates the struggles of the Jewish people and promotes a peaceful future. The author describes waking up to air-raid sirens the next morning, as conflict and violence erupted in the region. The article highlights the lack of support from Air India during the evacuation process and emphasizes that the focus should not be on predicting the future of the conflict but rather on understanding the reasons behind such wars. The partition of Palestine in 1948 is mentioned as a significant event that set the course for ongoing violence in the region. The author questions why wars allow acts of violence and calls for the restoration of a just and humane order. The article also discusses the role of politicians and media in perpetuating conflicts and emphasizes the fragility of human relations.

### [The labour market is tougher on women. This is what the Economics Nobel for 2023 acknowledges](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/labour-market-tougher-women-economics-nobel-2023-acknowledges-8977938/)

The 2023 Economics Nobel Prize has been awarded to Harvard economist Claudia Goldin for her work on gender gaps in labor markets. Goldin's research has shown that labor markets are not gender-neutral and that women face disadvantages in terms of occupation and wages, even when they are equally qualified as men. Her work has contributed to the understanding that labor markets function differently for men and women. Goldin's research has focused on how women's labor force participation and gender wage gaps have evolved historically, particularly in the United States. She has also examined factors such as occupational segregation and the impact of choices and agency on women's outcomes. Goldin's findings have implications for developing countries like India and raise important questions about gender inequalities in employment and domestic work. The recognition of Goldin's work with the Nobel Prize highlights the need for gender-sensitive economic analysis and policy-making that takes into account heterogeneity and intersectionality.

### [Fallout from flaring of West Asia conflict and the challenge for policymakers](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/fallout-from-flaring-of-west-asia-conflict-and-the-challenge-for-policymakers-8977070/)

The ongoing conflict in West Asia is impacting markets worldwide, including India. On Monday, Indian markets experienced weakness, with foreign portfolio investors pulling out close to Rs 1,000 crore. Crude oil prices rose around 4% due to fears of instability in the region. While Indian stock markets recovered on Tuesday, the continued conflict adds to global market uncertainty. The concern lies in the implications for crude oil prices, as higher prices could impact India's current account deficit, inflation, and fiscal situation. The Reserve Bank of India had factored in crude prices at $85 per barrel for 2023-24, but an escalation in the conflict could push prices higher. Retail prices may not fully reflect the increase as oil marketing companies and the government may bear the burden. Higher crude oil prices will also affect the current account deficit, which is expected to rise in the second quarter. The conflict may also impact the recently announced India-Middle East-Europe Economic Corridor. In this uncertain time, Indian policymakers must prioritize macroeconomic stability.

### [October 11, Forty Years Ago: S Korea’s Suspect](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/40-years-ago/october-11-forty-years-ago-s-koreas-suspect-8977087/)

South Korean President Chun Doo-Hwan blames North Korea for the explosion in Rangoon that killed 19 people, including four South Korean ministers. He pledges to take retaliatory measures against violence. The Home Ministry alerts states in India to take precautionary measures following incidents in Punjab where eight people were killed. The ministry asks states with a concentrated Sikh population to keep a close watch. The Bharatiya Janata Party organizes a Delhi bandh in protest against the killings in Punjab, resulting in closed markets. No untoward incidents are reported, but some shopkeepers claim they were forced to close by individuals carrying hockey sticks. In Thane district, a worker of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) is killed and another injured in retaliation for the burning down of a Sangathana worker's hut.

### [Women MPs’ contribution has increased in Parliament. Data proves it](https://indianexpress.com/article/columns/women-mps-contribution-has-increased-in-parliament-data-proves-it-8977046/)

The article discusses the impact of policies implemented by the Narendra Modi government on women in India. It highlights the positive effects of increased accessibility to LPG cooking fuel and improved toilet accessibility on women's health and safety. The article also mentions that a majority of beneficiaries of certain government schemes are women, contributing to their economic empowerment. 

The article then focuses on the achievements and contributions of women leaders in India's Parliament. It emphasizes the importance of women MPs questioning the government and holding it accountable, regardless of their political affiliation. The article argues that assessing women's political empowerment should go beyond counting their numbers in Parliament and should include evaluating their participation compared to male MPs.

To analyze this, the authors used data from the 15th and 16th Lok Sabha sessions, tracking MPs' activities such as questions asked, debates participated in, and introduction of bills. They found that during the 15th Lok Sabha, women MPs asked significantly fewer questions than male MPs, but in the 16th Lok Sabha, their level of engagement was on par with male MPs. 

The analysis also revealed that female MPs from the BJP (opposition party in the 15th Lok Sabha) asked more questions compared to female MPs from the INC (ruling party in the 15th Lok Sabha). In the 16th Lok Sabha, female MPs from the BJP posed the most substantial number of questions to their own government. This suggests an empowerment and encouragement of female MPs within the BJP under Prime Minister Modi's leadership.

Additionally, the article highlights that women MPs focus on different issues compared to their male counterparts. Female MPs prioritize healthcare, education, roads, and micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs), while male MPs focus more on finance, defense, external affairs, and prime minister's office.

Overall, the article presents a positive outlook on women's empowerment in Indian politics and suggests that these trends bode well for the future of women-led democracy in the country.

### [In Manipur, a government that’s worsening the conflict](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/in-manipur-a-government-thats-worsening-the-conflict-8977059/)

Manipur Chief Minister N Biren Singh has requested the central government to revoke the Free Movement Regime (FMR) agreement with Myanmar in order to address the issue of "illegal immigrants" and ongoing violence in the state. The FMR was temporarily suspended in September 2022 due to political unrest and an influx of refugees from Myanmar. However, India and Myanmar have not historically had violent boundary disputes, and most boundary settlements were arbitrary. The borderlands between Manipur and Myanmar are cultural spaces where people from the same ethnic stock live, and ethnic ties are often stronger than state-imposed borders. Only a small portion of the border is fenced, leaving the rest porous. Many villagers on the Indian side depend on economic activities in Myanmar for their livelihoods and rely on crossing the border for travel and medical facilities. The Kuki insurgent groups, who are engaged in peace negotiations with the Indian government, demand an extension of the FMR. The revocation of the FMR by Manipur's government could worsen tensions between different communities in the state. The article argues that a state-centric approach should be replaced with a consideration of the lived experiences and interactions in the borderland. The writer criticizes Singh's demand for revoking the ceasefire with Kuki insurgent groups without seeking a quick settlement and his blaming of them for the crisis without evidence. The central government is urged not to fall into a particular narrative without careful consideration.

The article discusses the importance of investigating and prosecuting media outlets, think tanks, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) if they are suspected of breaking the law. It emphasizes that these entities should be held accountable just like individuals or groups. However, it also highlights three propositions that need to be considered in the process. Firstly, law enforcement agencies must ensure that the evidence against these entities is strong enough to withstand judicial scrutiny to avoid wrongful imprisonment or unjustified closure of organizations. Secondly, efforts should be made to limit collateral damage and avoid involving individuals who may not have knowledge or involvement in illegal activities. This is particularly important for media outlets as a pervasive atmosphere of fear goes against democratic values. Lastly, matters related to laws with stringent bail provisions should be decided promptly, while also addressing the issue of undertrials languishing in jail. The article refers to a recent case where a media organization has been accused of receiving funds from Chinese propaganda machinery and argues that all countries engage in influencing others through various means. However, media outlets, NGOs, and think tanks should exercise caution in accepting funds from sources controlled by foreign governments as it may infringe the law. The article concludes by emphasizing the need to fight terrorism while preserving India's democratic values and social harmony, which is the responsibility of both the political class and senior civil servants.

The Chief Minister of Manipur, N Biren Singh, has faced criticism for his handling of ethnic violence in the state. He now recognizes the need to rebuild trust between different ethnic groups and has prioritized initiating dialogue with affected communities. However, Singh's focus on blaming "illegal migrants" for the crisis overlooks other political and administrative failures. While the government has cracked down on drug dealers, it should also address the state's low per capita income and improve livelihoods. Singh's emphasis on the outsider-infiltrator issue further exacerbates identity politics in Manipur. Rebuilding trust requires interventions at various levels, including economic, social, political, and administrative. The state government must act quickly to address these challenges.

Italian fashion brand Prada has partnered with Axiom Space to design spacesuits for NASA's Artemis III mission in 2025. This mission is significant as it is the first human mission to the moon since 1972 and includes the first person of color and a woman in its crew. Prada's experience in working with composite fabrics for sailing competitions will be applied to create spacesuits that prioritize mobility, safety, and comfort in space. The focus will be on the Exploration Extravehicular Mobility Unit (xEMU), which is crucial for spacewalks. While the technology and appearance of the suits may not change dramatically, Prada's involvement adds a touch of confidence and style to this historic mission.

### [IIT-B’s ‘vegetarian tables’ policy: Vegetarianism of purity promotes segregation, hierarchy and even violence](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/iit-bombay-vegetarianism-segregation-hierarchy-violence-8976874/)

The article discusses the changing dynamics of vegetarianism in India, particularly in urban spaces. It highlights that not all vegetarians adhere to strict rules of purity and segregation, and that mixed dining has become more common. The traditional caste basis of Indian vegetarianism is also facing erosion, with chicken becoming a more accepted meat option for some vegetarians. However, there are still militant vegetarians who seek to maintain the traditional ethics and aesthetics of segregation and hierarchy in food consumption. These individuals sometimes use arguments about compassion for animals and the environmental impact of meat production for political gain. The article also mentions incidents in Mumbai that highlight the divide between vegetarians and meat eaters, both in real estate and educational institutions. It argues that rules of segregation based on food preferences cannot be formally institutionalized, but there are informal social pressures and regulations. The article compares the prescriptions and proscriptions around meat consumption to menstrual cycles, noting similarities in how both are associated with shame and guilt. It concludes by stating that militant vegetarianism is a social illness that perpetuates segregation and hierarchy, and calls for embracing diversity and equality in public life.

The article discusses the changing dynamics of India's relationship with the Middle East, particularly in relation to Israel. It highlights five key changes in Indian policy under Prime Minister Narendra Modi: openly acknowledging and strengthening ties with Israel, aligning India's position with the realities on the ground in the Middle East, developing strategic partnerships with Arab countries, ending India's traditional anti-Western stance, and de-linking regional diplomacy from religion. The article argues that India's response to the recent Hamas attack on Israel underscores its interest-driven foreign policy and calls for a greater Indian contribution to stability and prosperity in the region.

A civil court in Bengaluru has ordered the social media platform X (formerly Twitter) to suspend the account of Dr. Cyriac Abby Philips, a gastroenterologist from Kerala known for debunking pseudoscience and traditional myths. The court order came after the Himalaya Wellness Company filed a case against Dr. Philips for criticizing their drug/supplement called Liv52. This incident highlights the growing embrace of irrationality and vulgar capitalism in India, where science and rationality are crucial in a country burdened with disease and poor healthcare infrastructure. The erosion of scientific temper is a sign of society drifting into obscurantism. The Covid-19 pandemic has further exacerbated this issue, with the promotion of unscientific quackery and magic cures by large companies and "gurus." The drug and wellness industry, driven by economic liberalization, holds significant power and influence over medical practices. Traditional systems of medicine are also experiencing a resurgence in India, reflecting a nationalistic mood. Any resentment towards these traditions is considered "anti-national," which is dangerous for constructing consent. Bollywood movies have also contributed to this insolent embrace of science and nationalism. However, science should not be bound by geographic boundaries or rhetoric. Court orders like the one against Dr. Philips further undermine scientific temper and tradition. It is essential for the judiciary, executive, and citizens to support science and scientific rationality over faith and tradition for the betterment of future generations.

The article discusses the Women Reservation Bill that was recently tabled in the Lok Sabha. The author questions whether the bill is truly about empowering women or if it is more politically motivated due to the upcoming general elections. The article highlights the low representation of women in legislative bodies and the long-awaited need for women's reservation. It mentions that the current version of the bill cannot be enforced until a new Census and delimitation process is undertaken, which could further delay its implementation. The article also compares the current bill to previous versions and raises concerns about intra-state representation and reserved seat rotation. It concludes by criticizing the delay in ensuring women's representation, stating that it goes against the ideals of India's visionary founders.

### [Five to go](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/five-to-go-8975470/)

The upcoming assembly elections in Mizoram, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, and Telangana will be closely watched for their implications on the major political players in the 2024 Lok Sabha elections. While there is no established correlation between assembly election outcomes and Lok Sabha votes, these results will still be analyzed for indications of national political trends. The Congress and BJP are in a head-to-head contest in three of the five states. The Congress will be judged on its organizational changes and Rahul Gandhi's attempt to create a new political narrative. Mallikarjun Kharge's leadership will also be tested, particularly in managing differences within the party in Rajasthan. The BJP relies heavily on the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi to win elections but may face challenges due to uncertainty about chief minister candidates. The polls may also reveal whether the OBC vote, which has been shifting towards the BJP, can be won back by other parties.

The article highlights the changing dynamics of sports fandom in India. It mentions how the Indian audience is becoming less emotionally invested in non-India cricket matches and exploring other sports showcased in events like the Asian Games. The author emphasizes the growing interest in Olympic disciplines and the camaraderie and nation-unifying moments they offer. The article also mentions specific instances of Indian athletes' achievements in various sports, capturing the attention and support of the nation. It concludes by suggesting that the Indian cricket team will have to do more than just winning the World Cup to regain the same level of affection from the Indian audience, as other sports are now gaining prominence and capturing hearts.

The operation was based on intelligence input, but it is unclear whether it was human intelligence or technical intelligence. The challenges of conducting anti-terrorist operations in deep forest mountainous terrains are highlighted. The article also mentions the role of the Pakistan Army and ISI in driving and financing terrorist violence in J&K. It suggests strengthening security infrastructure and deradicalizing sections of the Muslim youth as ways to address the issue. Additionally, it emphasizes the importance of winning the hearts and trust of Kashmiri Muslims and offering them more career options outside Jammu and Kashmir.

### [Law Commission age of consent recommendations threaten to criminalise the young](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/law-commission-report-lci-pocso-act-age-of-consent-8975442/)

The Law Commission of India (LCI) has advised against changing the age of consent under the Protection of Children from Sexual Offences (POCSO) Act. The increase in the age of consent from 16 to 18 years with the enactment of POCSO has led to an increase in prosecutions against adolescents engaged in consensual sexual activity. The LCI report recommends retaining the age of consent at 18 and providing judicial discretion for sentence reduction. However, there are flaws in this recommendation, including the lack of a close-in-age exception as a defense and the introduction of the term "tacit approval" instead of "consent." The report also includes a checklist of circumstances for exemption, which may favor socially conforming marriages. Protecting young people from sexual abuse is important, but it is also crucial to protect them from being shamed and incarcerated for exploring their sexuality. The Convention on the Rights of the Child calls for age-appropriate sexuality education and prohibits laws that criminalize consensual sexual activity with peers. Criminalization disproportionately affects marginalized communities and can lead to further violations. The matter now rests with the courts to address on a case-by-case basis.

### [Don’t force feed](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/dont-force-feed-8975490/)

The Goa government wants to promote and preserve the state's cuisine, but the decision to make it mandatory for beach shacks to serve fish curry and rice raises questions about government interference. While Goa's cuisine is rich and varied, many tourists remain unaware or uninterested in native dishes. The current menus of most shacks cater to a different crowd with items like sizzlers, pasta, fries, and dal fry. It is uncertain whether mandating fish curry and rice will increase the visibility of Goan cuisine. Other countries have successfully promoted their culinary heritage without resorting to mandates, such as Copenhagen's focus on local ingredients and Peru's cookbooks and festivals. While Goan food is delicious, forcing businesses to serve it may not be the best approach.

India experienced its warmest February and driest August on record this year, indicating the effects of climate change. Unseasonal showers during the summer impacted consumer demand for ice-cream, cold beverages, air-conditioners, and refrigerators. Climate change is no longer limited to agriculture, as non-farm businesses are also affected by unpredictable weather patterns. Economic policymakers should incorporate climate change into growth and planning models, investing in knowledge about extreme weather events and developing strategies for adaptation. A national climate adaptation strategy involving government, industry, meteorologists, agricultural scientists, and disaster management specialists is necessary.

The article reports on several events that occurred in different countries. In Rangoon, a bomb explosion at the martyrs mausoleum killed 19 people, including four South Korean cabinet ministers, just minutes before the arrival of South Korean President Chun Doo-Hwan. The president and his wife narrowly escaped the explosion as they were driving in a motorcade to lay a wreath at the tomb of Burma's national hero, Gen Aung San. India's President Zail Singh and Prime Minister Indira Gandhi expressed shock over the tragedy. 

India also issued a warning to Pakistan regarding baseless and mischievous reports and comments about India in Pakistan's press. India stated that such reports only served to promote suspicions and misapprehensions, hindering the normalization and improvement of relations between the two countries. The Indian Embassy specifically mentioned recent editorials in a Karachi-based Urdu daily, Jasarat.

In New Delhi, two men named Kartar Singh and Ujagar Singh were hanged at Tihar Jail for the murder of Vidya Jain in December 1973. The condemned men showed no fear or emotion before their execution and asked for forgiveness if they had made mistakes.

Lastly, the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) called for a complete hartal (strike) in Delhi to protest against sustained massacres and arson in Punjab. Prominent BJP leaders were visiting various markets in the city to encourage traders to observe the hartal.

### [Why Hamas attacked now – and how it weakens both Israel and hopes for peace](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/why-hamas-attacked-now-and-how-it-weakens-both-israel-and-hopes-for-peace-8975064/)

The recent attack by Hamas in Israel is seen as a major defeat for Israel and a setback for peace efforts in the region. Israel's failure is attributed to poor intelligence and military preparedness, which has shattered its reputation of invincibility. In response, Israel is launching a massive attack on Gaza to restore its deterrence, but it is uncertain if this will be successful. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's political future is also in question due to the loss of Israeli lives and hostages in Hamas's hands. The Palestinians are also losers as the attack is unlikely to bring them closer to establishing their state or destroying Israel. Instead, it will lead to more violence and misery for the Palestinians. The attack happened because Hamas wants to assert its leadership over the Palestinian cause and undermine the Palestinian Authority (PA), which is seen as complicit with Israel and lacking legitimacy. Additionally, Hamas aims to disrupt the process of normalization between Israel and Gulf Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabia. This attack makes it unlikely that a peace agreement can be reached soon, as Saudi Arabia would find it difficult to make peace with a country attacking an Arab population under brutal Israeli occupation. The article argues that both Iran and Hamas's vision of violent resistance and the Gulf Arab states' emphasis on peace are flawed. The destruction of Israel is unrealistic due to its strength and Western support, while the Gulf Arab approach lacks sufficient emphasis on creating a viable Palestinian state. The author suggests that reviving the Arab Peace Initiative, which calls for a Palestinian state based on pre-1967 borders, could be a solution. Cooler heads must prevail to think about long-term resolutions rather than escalating violence. The Biden administration, Saudi Arabia, and centrist politicians in Israel have an opportunity to seize this moment and work towards peace by prioritizing the creation of a Palestinian state. Without this resolution, more rounds of violent confrontation are likely to occur in the future.

### [With Israel-Hamas conflict, Maldives President-elect Miuzzu cannot be too ‘pro-China’](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/israel-hamas-conflict-maldives-president-elect-miuzzu-not-pro-china-8974856/)

The article discusses the recent presidential election in the Maldives and its implications for India, China, and other countries in the region. Mohamed Muizzu, the candidate from the Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM)-People's National Congress (PNC), was projected as a "pro-China" leader by global media. Muizzu had been critical of India-Maldives relations during his campaign, but after his election, he pledged to withdraw foreign military personnel without naming any specific country.

The article highlights that while India's influence in the Maldives may not be the same as during the previous president's term, Beijing will also not enjoy the privileged position it had under Abdulla Yameen. The changing geopolitical dynamics in the Indo-Pacific region, particularly tensions between QUAD members and China, have increased the strategic significance of the Maldives.

The United States has been strengthening its ties with the Maldives through defense deals, joint military training exercises, and diplomatic engagements. Other countries like Japan, Australia, and the United Kingdom have also been actively engaging with the Maldives. Saudi Arabia, which had close relations with Yameen's government, is an important partner for both China and India.

The article emphasizes that Muizzu must navigate carefully considering the fast-changing global situation and escalating rivalry in the Indo-Pacific region. While branding him as a "pro-China" leader may be convenient, it may not be reasonable for him to completely deviate from the foreign policy practiced by his predecessor. However, Beijing may still have more advantages under Muizzu's leadership compared to other countries.

### [Why the demand for Khalistan finds no echo in Punjab](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/india-canada-diplomatic-row-pro-khalistan-activist-killing-sikh-community-8973976/)

The article discusses the diplomatic dispute between India and Canada regarding the killing of a pro-Khalistan activist. The author reflects on their experience delivering a talk on violence in Punjab in 1989 and the differing views on Punjabi culture and history. They argue that while Indian Punjab has moved on from the divisive events of the past, there are still dramatically divergent views within the diaspora Punjab community. The article highlights the presence of radical groups in diaspora Punjab who advocate for Khalistan and remain separate from Canadian society. In contrast, Indian Punjab has nurtured a secular Punjabi identity that coexists with religious assertions. The author emphasizes the need for closure and de-legitimization of violence to address the ongoing separatist movement. They criticize both the Canadian and Indian political establishments for their handling of the situation, which has led to trade suspensions and restrictions on human resource exchange. The article warns that this political controversy could exacerbate tensions between nations and create divisions among religious groups in Canada.

### [October 9, Forty Years Ago: Opposition Conclave](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/october-9-forty-years-ago-opposition-conclave-8974004/)

The three-day Opposition conclave in Srinagar has called for the people to save the country from disintegration by addressing the centralisation of power and distortion of the Constitution. They are seeking a review of Centre-state relations and changes in the current centralised pattern of economic and financial administration. The Sri Lankan government is reportedly planning an operation to remove stateless Tamils of Indian origin who have been illegally settled on government lands in the Vavuniya district. The operation will be carried out by a newly-set up joint services special operations command. Rajiv Gandhi, general secretary of the All India Congress (I) Committee, criticized Congress (I) ruled states for providing false figures about their activities and urged for the setting up of special courts to address atrocities against Harijans. The Indian government is keeping a close eye on Pakistani troop movements on the Rajasthan border, considering them to be a diversionary tactic to distract from internal disturbances.

India achieved a significant milestone at the Hangzhou Asian Games by winning 107 medals, joining China, Japan, and Korea in the elite sporting club with a three-digit tally. While China dominated with 200 golds, India's performance in shooting, hockey, wrestling, and kabaddi helped break the psychological barrier. Shooting stood out with 22 medals, including 7 golds, showcasing India's talent and potential to compete with China. Athletics also performed well, earning 29 medals, with Neeraj Chopra's consistency in javelin throwing providing hope for future Olympic success. Compound archery excelled but is not yet an Olympic sport. Rowing and boxing contributed five medals each but need to improve their gold medal count for the Paris Games. Wrestling underwent necessary changes for women's safety but missed out on gold medals from Vinesh Phogat and Bajrang Punia. Boxer Nikhat Zareen's missed gold served as a wake-up call to avoid complacency. Golf and badminton secured silvers but missed out on golds. However, Satwiksairaj Ranki Reddy and Chirag Shetty made history by winning India's first Asiad gold in men's doubles badminton. Wushu athlete Roshibina Devi's emotional silver medal raised important questions about ongoing conflicts in Manipur and China's visa policy affecting Arunachal athletes. Cricket's two golds were controversial due to weather disruptions. Notably, Ayhika and Sutirtha Mukherjee beating China in table tennis doubles quarters was a memorable achievement. Overall, India's success in hockey, kabaddi, table tennis, and badminton against strong Asian competitors signifies significant progress.

### [Building an India for manufacturers](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/the-rise-of-services-8973972/)

India's services sector is undergoing two major leaps that could shape the country's growth trajectory. Firstly, services exports to the rest of the world have seen significant growth, with revenues increasing by $60 billion annually compared to three years ago. India has moved up the value chain and now offers a range of professional services beyond IT, including accounting, legal, HR, and R&D. Additionally, India boasts the largest share in Global Capability Centres (GCCs), which provide higher-value-added services like legal, audit, design, and R&D. While IT services exports have grown rapidly, there is potential for further growth in professional and consulting services exports. Factors such as a permanent change in remote work attitudes, a diverse skills portfolio, cost-competitiveness, and India's position at a tipping point suggest continued growth in services exports. 

Secondly, domestic services in India are also evolving. The country has a strong digital public infrastructure that supports tech start-ups focused on the services sector. Over time, these start-ups could expand into manufacturing and agriculture sectors to address challenges faced by small manufacturers. By leveraging digital infrastructure to solve problems related to credit access, raw materials, markets, logistics, and quality checks, start-ups can incentivize small manufacturers to expand and create more jobs. The rise of modern services in India has the potential to energize manufacturing and drive economic growth and job creation.

Overall, India's services sector is experiencing significant transformations both in terms of exports and domestic offerings. These developments have the potential to shape India's growth trajectory and address challenges in job creation and manufacturing sector development.

The article discusses the recent actions taken by the Delhi Police's Special Cell, which raided multiple locations and arrested two individuals linked to the news portal NewsClick. The arrests were made under the UAPA, a terror law, and the FIR against NewsClick founder-editor Prabir Purkayastha contains language that paints criticism of the Indian government as anti-national and equates it with terrorism. The article raises concerns about the loose association of guilt implied in the FIR and questions the political strategy of the BJP-led Centre. It also mentions the targeting of the media and political opponents by the government using agencies like ED-CBI. Despite these actions, there is little evidence that they are negatively impacting the government electorally. The article also discusses a caste survey conducted by the Bihar government, which highlights the need to address caste-based inequalities. However, it warns against using population numbers without considering socio-economic data, as it can lead to majoritarian arguments on caste that may not be beneficial.

The recent terror attack in southern Israel by Hamas has shattered hopes for a peaceful "New Middle East". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had been discussing the possibility of normalizing ties with Arab countries, particularly Saudi Arabia. However, the attack has pushed Netanyahu to declare war and undermined the peace movement in Israel. Iran, a supporter of Hamas, has used the attack to undermine Saudi efforts to normalize ties with Israel and gain leadership in the region. This attack will also make it more difficult for India to pursue its strategic ambitions in the Middle East. The plans for an India-Middle East-Europe Corridor and Delhi's security partnerships in the region will be affected by the renewed violence.

The Senate Standing Committee on Interior in Pakistan passed a bill in favor of public hanging of rapists, but critics argue that rehabilitation should be prioritized over punitive measures. Pakistan reported its third case of polio this year, highlighting the distrust between people and the government. A World Bank report suggested increasing taxes for more income categories in Pakistan, causing outrage among the salaried class already struggling with high inflation and electricity bills.

Despite growing up in rural Uttar Pradesh without means, Baboo's perseverance and determination led him to success. The article highlights that Baboo's achievements were supported by a welfare state and rights-based development architecture. It challenges the notion that welfare goods provided by the state are "freebies" and emphasizes that they are citizens' due. Baboo's journey included attending a government-sponsored boarding school and receiving support during the COVID-19 pandemic through a government scheme. The article argues that while individual achievement should be recognized, it is important to acknowledge the structures and institutions that enable success.

The author suggests that the Congress Party needs a solid political platform and message, rather than relying on promises of freebies that could harm the economy. In contrast, Prime Minister Narendra Modi is praised for his clear message and efficient delivery of welfare schemes. Overall, the article raises concerns about the upcoming general election in India and its potential to escalate into a civil war-like situation.

The recently released Bihar caste survey reveals that Lalu Prasad, not Nitish Kumar, is the real winner. Lalu's Yadav community makes up 14.27% of the population, along with 17.7% Muslims, which could be a winning combination. This has caught the BJP off guard, as they had planned their 2024 poll strategy around Hindutva sentiment. The Mandal parties hope to make a comeback. The BJP may counter with a demand for the implementation of the Rohini Commission report, which focuses on economically backward classes (EBCs) among OBCs. Prabir Purkayastha, founder of NewsClick portal, has been arrested for the second time, this time under a wrong law. He was detained for allegedly not disclosing large sums received from a millionaire close to the Chinese government. The police also raided the homes of 46 journalists, many of whom were not even on the staff of the portal. Rahul Gandhi made some unwise statements in public recently, causing embarrassment for others in the Congress party. After the SP's win in an assembly by-election, SP leader Ram Gopal Yadav called for an alliance with BSP for the 2024 parliamentary poll.

### [Women’s Reservation Bill and the unfair burden of expectations: We must be excellent, while men can just get by](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/womens-reservation-bill-men-expectations-speaking-for-myself-8972332/)

The Lok Sabha recently passed the Women's Reservation Bill, which provides 33% reservation for women in the Lok Sabha and state legislative assemblies. Supporters of the bill argue that it will empower women, increase their representation in decision-making spaces, address social issues affecting women, and serve as role models for younger women. However, this article argues that placing higher expectations on women to be better leaders than their male counterparts is a burden that stems from patriarchy. The author shares personal experiences of feeling the need to excel in order to be acknowledged, while boys were praised for doing the minimum. The article also challenges the assumption that women are naturally more responsible and collaborative, suggesting that these qualities are forced upon them due to societal gender roles. Additionally, the article questions why current leaders have not prioritized social issues until now and highlights the importance of education for women in uplifting communities. It concludes by acknowledging the sacrifices made by women to attain positions of power and emphasizes the need to consider the impact on other women in households.

The article discusses the speculation surrounding a possible name change for India to Bharat. The invitation extended by President Droupadi Murmu referred to "the President of Bharat," sparking rumors that a resolution regarding the country's name change could be moved during a special session of Parliament. However, constitutionally, "India" and "Bharat" are synonymous, with the latter being used in Hindi communications. The article highlights the BJP government's emphasis on promoting the Hindi language and Hindu culture, which is seen as part of their objective to establish a Hindu Rashtra. The author argues that renaming the country as Bharat would ignore its diversity and secularism. They also discuss the historical significance of both names and the challenges that would come with changing the name in official documents. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for a sensitive balance among linguistic interests in India and criticizes the government's attempt to homogenize a diverse country.

### [D K Joshi writes: RBI’s Monetary Policy and the art of letting it be](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/rbi-monetary-policy-review-repo-rate-8971703/)

The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has decided to maintain the current interest rates and continue with its stance of withdrawing accommodation. The decision is influenced by both domestic and external factors, including rising prices of food items and volatile crude oil prices. The transmission of past rate hikes to bank lending and deposit rates remains incomplete, which has further supported the decision to hold the stance of "withdrawal of accommodation". Systemically important central banks, such as the US Federal Reserve, have also continued with hawkish monetary policies, contributing to the external triggers. Inflation control remains a challenge for central banks in advanced countries, leading them to keep rates higher for longer. This has resulted in the US 10-year treasury yield reaching its highest level in 16 years and attracting capital away from emerging markets. Despite these challenges, India's growth has remained strong, but supply shocks amid healthy growth will keep the RBI cautious. The RBI has raised its inflation forecast for this fiscal year due to increased food inflation. Concerns over cereals, pulses, and spices inflation persist, along with suboptimal reservoir levels and potential risks from volatile crude oil prices. However, global demand conditions are expected to weaken, which may offset some of these risks. Inflationary expectations have remained anchored so far, but supply shocks can transmit inflationary pressures to other parts of the economy. As a result, the MPC is unlikely to make any changes to interest rates in the near future.

The Shivraj Singh Chouhan government in Madhya Pradesh has decided to reserve 35% of all government jobs for women, excluding the forest department. This move is seen as a positive step ahead of the upcoming Assembly elections. Political parties across states have been implementing various initiatives to address the needs of female voters, such as providing free or subsidized transport, healthcare, housing schemes, cheap cooking gas cylinders, and increased maternity benefits. This shows a growing awareness of the issues faced by women in India and a shift away from a male-centric discourse. However, it is important to ensure that these policies do not create further divisions or restrict opportunities for women. The discussion on women's rights should be nuanced and avoid reducing them to mere beneficiaries of benevolence. Lessons from other areas of social justice should be applied to ensure that representation and empowerment lead to consensus rather than becoming a source of conflict.

This article highlights Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ability to build consensus, which is a quality that has not received much attention. The recent G20 Summit, led by India, ended with a resolute decision to reduce global tensions and increase representation from the Global South. PM Modi was able to turn areas of trust deficit into bridges of shared confidence and amplify the voices of the Global South. This approach is characteristic of his leadership style, as he aims to bring all stakeholders together and find solutions to deep-rooted issues. Examples of this include resolving the Land Boundary Agreement with Bangladesh and championing a collaborative spirit during the implementation of the Goods and Services Tax (GST). PM Modi's commitment to consensus-building extends to his tenure as Chief Minister of Gujarat, where he emphasized bridging divides and creating unity within communities. Overall, PM Modi's adeptness at rallying diverse groups behind a common goal is essential in our multifaceted world.

### [An uncertain inflation outlook increases possibilities of RBI keeping rates high](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/an-uncertain-inflation-outlook-increases-possibilities-of-rbi-keeping-rates-high-8971717/)

The Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy committee has voted to maintain the current interest rates and continue focusing on withdrawing accommodation. Inflation remains above the central bank's target, with risks of further increases due to high global energy prices and market volatility. Food prices are a major factor contributing to inflation uncertainty, as rainfall has been below average and there are concerns about the impact of El Nino. Core inflation, excluding food and fuel, has decreased, but there is a risk that elevated food inflation could influence household inflation expectations. Despite the rise in headline inflation, the RBI has kept its forecast unchanged at 5.4% for the year. The World Bank, however, has raised its forecast for India's inflation to 5.9%. The RBI's growth forecast remains at 6.5%, suggesting economic momentum is holding up. The MPC must consider both domestic and global risks when making decisions to ensure price stability.

The author suggests that Gandhi's version of Hinduism, centered around fear, anger, hatred, and love, was likely a response to attacks on Hinduism by his alliance colleagues. While the author agrees with some of Gandhi's points, such as Hinduism not being limited to a particular nation or geography, they argue that his understanding is superficial. The author questions Gandhi's true beliefs and compares him to his great grandfather, Jawaharlal Nehru, who was known to be a non-believer but wrote eloquently about Indian spirituality. The author also criticizes Gandhi for using his views on Hinduism as political tools to attack his adversaries. They argue that Gandhi's statements about non-violence and love are contradicted by his consistent display of hatred towards his opponents. The author concludes by stating that Hinduism cannot be fully understood in one article or election cycle.

### [Pratap Bhanu Mehta writes: The opacity of Vladimir Putin and the fate of the Ukraine war](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/pratap-bhanu-mehta-writes-the-opacity-of-vladimir-putin-and-the-fate-of-the-ukraine-war-8970338/)

The article discusses the current political developments in America and Europe regarding the war in Ukraine. It highlights that the Republican Party in the US is becoming more skeptical about funding Ukraine, while pro-Russia political forces are gaining strength in Europe. The author emphasizes the importance of containing Vladimir Putin's aggression towards Ukraine, as it would have set a dangerous precedent for international politics. However, Russia failed to achieve its strategic objectives, and Ukraine emerged as a nation. The article raises three key questions: how the objectives of the war are defined, the impact of the war on economies and societies, and the situation on the ground in Ukraine. It suggests that the outcome of the war may depend on capabilities rather than objectives, as Russia has imperial ambitions but lacks the necessary resources to execute them. The author also notes that Western support for Ukraine may dwindle due to domestic political pressures. The article concludes by highlighting the opacity of Putin's political calculations and the need for a negotiated settlement that secures Ukraine's sovereignty and prosperity.

### [Counting rural women’s labour](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/counting-rural-womens-labour-8970333/)

India has one of the lowest female labor force participation rates in the world, lower than most South Asian countries except Afghanistan and Pakistan. The Periodic Labour Force Survey data shows that the female LFPR is only 35.6% in India, with rural and urban areas having participation rates of 39.3% and 26.5%, respectively. The increase in rural women's LFPR is mainly due to self-employment, with a majority working in agriculture and allied activities as unpaid family helpers. Married women are more likely to engage in unpaid family work or domestic chores. Rural women working as wage workers face a higher gender wage gap compared to urban women, and self-employed women earn less than half of men's earnings. A significant proportion of women are involved in unpaid essential activities and are not considered part of the labor force. Women spend over five hours daily on unpaid domestic services and over two hours on unpaid caregiving services in rural areas. They also spend over seven hours growing crops for the market and household use. However, only 14.7% of operational landholdings in agriculture are owned by women, reflecting gender disparity in land ownership. The Union government's expenditure on agriculture has shifted towards cash-based schemes, but gender-wise beneficiary data shows that only a small percentage of women farmers receive financial support from these schemes due to the requirement of land ownership. The article emphasizes the need to recognize and include the unpaid and underpaid contributions of rural women in agricultural schemes to address gender inequality in rural India.

### [Apar Gupta writes: In Manipur, another internet shutdown, a conflict intensified](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/apar-gupta-writes-in-manipur-another-internet-shutdown-a-conflict-intensified-8970390/)

On September 23, 2023, Manipur's chief minister announced the restoration of full internet access, ending the country's second-longest internet blackout. However, just two days later, images of two slain Meitei students led to protests and another shutdown of mobile internet access. The article questions the efficacy of internet shutdowns in preventing violence, citing previous incidents that followed a similar pattern of violence preceding internet restoration and subsequent shutdowns. The lack of protection for citizens raises concerns about the chief minister's competence and the government's motives for implementing shutdowns. The article also criticizes the institutions that should provide checks on the government, such as the union government and the department of telecom, for either supporting or ignoring internet shutdowns. The Supreme Court and the High Court of Manipur have avoided addressing the issue, while public attention on net neutrality has overshadowed the issue of limited internet shutdowns. The private sector, including major telecom players, is also urged to consider the implications of service-level blocks advocated by internet companies. The article concludes that without accountability from those in power, internet shutdowns will continue to hinder public assembly and protest, perpetuating a cycle of violence and eroding public trust.

### [In a world obsessed with what’s spoken, Nobel laureate Jon Fosse articulates what is not](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/in-a-world-obsessed-with-whats-spoken-nobel-laureate-jon-fosse-articulates-what-is-not-8970370/)

Norwegian playwright Jon Fosse has been awarded this year's Nobel Prize in Literature for his innovative plays and prose that give voice to the unsayable. Fosse's ability to listen to words and silence has allowed him to tap into the ordinary and extraordinary aspects of life. His works, such as Red Black, Melancholy I and II, Morning and Evening, and Septology, explore the philosophy that what cannot be said must be written. Like last year's winner Annie Ernaux, Fosse delves into personal experiences to examine the boundaries between the private, personal, and universal. The recognition of Fosse by the Nobel committee is both a political statement and a reaffirmation of his eminence in continental Europe. In Norway, Fosse is considered an institution, with an annual international festival dedicated to his works. His sparse yet nuanced prose is now being translated and gaining recognition worldwide, showcasing the timeless power of literature to explore the universal and political through introspection.

### [Sikkim warning: Hydroelectricity push must be accompanied by safety measures](https://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/editorials/sikkim-warning-hydroelectricity-push-must-be-accompanied-by-safety-measures-8970365/)

At least 14 people have died and over 100 are missing in Sikkim, India, after the Teesta river flooded due to a combination of factors. A cloud burst caused the South Shonak Lake to rupture, leading to flash floods in four districts. The release of water from the Chungthang dam and a possible earthquake in Nepal may have also contributed to the disaster. Experts have long warned about the vulnerability of the South Shonak Lake due to glacial melting. Guidelines from the National Disaster Management Authority emphasize the need for mapping and monitoring such water bodies and implementing measures to prevent breaches. The Indian Meteorological Department collaborates with the US National Weather Service to issue flash flood warnings, but more needs to be done to address the unique challenges of the Himalayan region. The construction of dams for hydropower projects, like the Chungthang Dam, has been promoted as climate-friendly, but ecologists warn about their adverse effects on rock stability. This recent disaster highlights the importance of taking these concerns seriously and implementing robust safety measures.
