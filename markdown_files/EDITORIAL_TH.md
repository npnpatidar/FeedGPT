### [To abide or not: On the Karnataka case and corruption charges](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/to-abide-or-not-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-karnataka-case-and-corruption-charges/article68543330.ece)

The Karnataka Governor's decision to grant permission for prosecution against Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on corruption charges has sparked debate.  The legality of the Governor's action, independent of the Council of Ministers' advice, is questioned. Siddaramaiah contends that the Governor disregarded advice to refuse sanction.  The case revolves around land allotment by the Mysore Urban Development Authority, with allegations of impropriety. 

While the State government supports a judicial inquiry, the Governor deems it insufficient. The Chief Minister denies involvement in the land allocation process, maintaining it occurred during the previous BJP government. The Governor's action highlights the ongoing tension between the executive and the judiciary, and raises concerns about potential selective prosecution.

The selections seem to reflect a shift towards meaningful cinema that resonates with contemporary issues, vindicating the National Awards' original purpose.

The assembly elections in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir, scheduled from September 18 to October 1, will be closely watched as they test India's democratic processes. The elections, the first for J&K since its reorganization in 2019, are significant as a new government could be a crucial step towards a lasting political solution. 

Security concerns and festivals are cited as reasons for staggered elections, with Maharashtra and Jharkhand polls to be announced later. The outcome will have implications beyond the two states, influencing national politics and signaling the BJP’s electoral strength a year before the general election.

Sri Lanka is holding its ninth presidential election on September 21st with a record 39 candidates. Incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, running as an independent, hopes to leverage the political and economic stability achieved during his tenure.  He faces challenges from Sajith Premadasa of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, Anura Kumara Dissanayake of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, and Namal Rajapaksa of the SLPP.  The election comes after Sri Lanka faced a severe economic crisis in 2022, prompting a debt restructuring and the ousting of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.  The candidates, including representatives of the Aragalaya movement, will seek to address public concerns about the economy and traditional politics.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), following a declaration by the Africa CDC as a public health emergency of continental security (PHECS).  This marks the first time a regional and global health emergency has been declared for a disease outbreak in Africa. 

The current outbreak, driven by the more lethal clade 1b virus, has seen 2,863 confirmed cases and 517 deaths primarily in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Concerns remain over vaccine supply, with only 0.21 million doses expected immediately against a need for 10 million.  Doses are currently authorized only in the DRC and Nigeria, highlighting the need for wider authorization and expedited global distribution.

### [Neighbourhood troubles: On India and instability in the region](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/neighbourhood-troubles-on-india-and-instability-in-the-region/article68533413.ece)

Thailand's Parliament elected Paetongtarn Shinawatra, at 37 the country's youngest Prime Minister. This follows the Constitutional Court's ousting of Srettha Thavisin due to ethical violations related to his Cabinet's appointment of someone convicted in a corruption case involving Paetongtarn's father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.  

The Shinawatra family has a history of facing court dismissals, highlighting Thailand's political instability. Paetongtarn's path to reform and economic recovery is likely to be challenging due to the conservative establishment's influence and her limited experience. She is expected to rely heavily on her father's guidance.

Prime Minister Modi's Independence Day address emphasized continuity and authority in his third term. He championed a uniform civil code, 'one nation, one election,' and enhanced women's safety. 

Modi criticized attempts to destabilize the economy, echoing the BJP's stance on the Hindenburg Research report. He called for  one lakh first-generation young leaders in politics. Reviewing his previous terms, he highlighted progress in manufacturing and fighting corruption.  The article critiques the government's partisan approach on these issues, noting the lack of consensus building and the targeting of opposition figures in corruption inquiries. It emphasizes the importance of accountability and criticism as essential aspects of a functioning democracy.

### [​Choppy waters: On shrinking exports](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bchoppy-waters-on-shrinking-exports/article68529172.ece)

India's merchandise exports fell 1.5% in July, marking their weakest performance since November 2023. While sectors like electronics, garments, and handicrafts showed growth, declines in petroleum, gems and jewellery, and chemicals hampered overall export performance.  

Imports surged 7.5% due to increased petroleum and consumer demand, leading to a 24% jump in the trade deficit. This was attributed to both a decrease in export growth and a rise in imports. The Commerce Ministry remains optimistic about India surpassing last year's export record, but uncertainties like geopolitical disruptions and weak global demand pose challenges.

### [​Illusory blip: On inflation](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Billusory-blip-on-inflation/article68524975.ece)

India's retail inflation eased to a 3.54% rise in July, its lowest in nearly five years. This slowdown was largely due to a 13-month low in food inflation, reaching 5.4%. While the Consumer Price Index (CPI) aligned with the Reserve Bank of India's target for the first time since August 2019, the MPC expects inflation to rebound later in the year. This is attributed to base effects and the persistence of price pressures in food items like pulses, despite a decline in vegetable inflation. Services inflation also saw a rise, driven by higher transport and communication costs. Though the July figures offer some relief, experts caution against complacency, as Monsoon uncertainties and continued food price pressures may hinder a sustainable decline in inflation.

The brutal rape and murder of a postgraduate medical student in a Kolkata government hospital has sparked national outrage. The incident, highlighting the systemic failures in ensuring safety within hospitals, has revealed a disturbing pattern of violence against healthcare professionals.  Public anger prompted authorities to act after initially attempting to cover up the crime. 

The case echoes previous attacks on doctors, including the murder of Dr. Vandana Das in Kerala and numerous assaults during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating the urgent need for improved security and legislation to protect healthcare workers. The government must take proactive steps to prevent such tragedies and ensure the safety of those who dedicate their lives to saving others.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is facing allegations of bias and conflict of interest concerning its Chairperson, Madhabi Puri Buch.  Hindenburg Research claims Ms. Buch and her husband made investments in offshore funds where Adani Group's Vinod Adani also invested, while their consultancy firms in Singapore and India potentially advised SEBI-regulated clients.  Ms. Buch claims her consultancy firms were inactive since her SEBI appointment, but Hindenburg disputes this, citing revenue figures. This unprecedented situation raises concerns about SEBI's impartiality in its ongoing investigation into the Adani Group for alleged stock market manipulation.  

The integrity of India's securities regulator is at stake,  leading to calls for Ms. Buch's resignation to allow for a thorough investigation.

India's performance at the Paris Olympics fell short of expectations, securing one silver and five bronze medals, a decline from the previous Games. While new stars emerged in shooting and wrestling, the country's reliance on a few athletes was evident.  The lack of representation in disciplines like swimming and gymnastics, coupled with wrestler Vinesh Phogat's disqualification, highlighted areas for improvement.  Broadening the sport's base, increasing participation, and ensuring equitable funding distribution are crucial for future success.

The Election Commission of India's recent visit to Jammu and Kashmir signals a push for assembly elections in the Union Territory.  The Supreme Court has directed the ECI to hold elections by September 30, 2024, emphasizing that direct elections cannot be delayed until statehood is restored.  J&K's last Assembly election was in 2014,  and the region has been under central rule since 2019. The Centre is encouraged by the high voter turnout in the recent Lok Sabha elections, indicating a possible receptiveness to democratic processes. Holding Assembly elections is seen as a vital step towards restoring normalcy, addressing pressing issues like unemployment and infrastructure, and fostering healing in the region.

The Zika virus outbreak in Maharashtra, with 88 confirmed cases as of early August, has raised concerns, particularly regarding pregnant women. Although rare, Zika can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome and poses a significant risk to fetuses, potentially leading to microcephaly and neurological impairments. Studies have shown a substantial risk of birth defects and complications associated with Zika infection during pregnancy.  The virus can also be transmitted sexually by infected men for at least two months, highlighting the need for awareness and preventive measures.  

The slow response in initiating testing capacity in Pune underscores the importance of robust and decentralized testing infrastructure, as demonstrated by the effectiveness of such systems during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala. Prompt testing and sequencing of potential pathogens are crucial for effective public health interventions and containing outbreaks.

The Supreme Court's bail grant to Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia emphasizes that bail should not be denied as punishment. Bail is generally granted in cases primarily based on documentary evidence, unless there's a flight risk, witness tampering, or significant trial delay. The court's order highlights the importance of speedy trials and cautions against judges "playing safe" by denying bail routinely.  Sisodia's case, involving prolonged detention and alleged political targeting, underscores the need for the judiciary to protect citizens' liberty and ensure fair trials without unnecessary pre-trial imprisonment. The court's emphasis on time-bound completion of trials is a crucial safeguard in situations where investigations are perceived to be politically motivated.

The Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar (RVP) replaces the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar (SSB) awards for scientists under 45. The new award scheme includes the Vigyan Shri, Vigyan Ratna and Vigyan Team awards, with a cap of 56 total awards across categories.  While the RVP aims to streamline and elevate scientific recognition in India, emphasizing both individual and team achievements, some critics argue the awards should prioritize improved funding and infrastructure for research.  The list of awardees primarily represents scientists from elite institutions, highlighting the existing disparities in access to resources within the scientific community.

Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, head of Bangladesh's interim government, has called for calm amidst widespread violence and unrest following former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation. Clashes between political parties and extremist groups have targeted religious minorities and Awami League supporters. Yunus, chosen for his perceived neutrality, faces the challenge of restoring order, preventing military intervention, and facilitating peaceful elections. Building a temporary truce between political rivals, notably the Jamaat and BNP, is crucial, along with ensuring free and fair elections to regain public trust and stability. The success of Bangladesh's current transition hinges on addressing these critical challenges.

The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee has maintained its benchmark interest rates for the ninth consecutive meeting. This decision stems from ongoing concerns about persistently high inflation, which has exceeded the targeted 4% for an extended period, impacting consumer confidence. 

Governor Shaktikanta Das emphasized the threat posed by elevated food prices, particularly given their significant weight in the Consumer Price Index and direct impact on household budgets.  Although vegetable prices had shown some softening in June, the MPC anticipates continued pressure on inflation, potentially extending into the festive season. The committee raised its inflation projections for the remaining fiscal year, signaling a less optimistic outlook.

They highlighted the risks of spillovers from food prices to other goods and services, as well as potential inflationary effects from mobile tariff revisions. The MPC reiterated the crucial link between price stability and sustainable economic growth.

Vinesh Phogat's Olympic journey ended in heartbreak when she was found 100 grams overweight before her final bout in the women's 50kg category. Despite weighing in successfully the previous day, she gained weight overnight. Desperate attempts to shed the extra kilos proved futile. Though Vinesh had triumphed over reigning champion Yui Susaki and Cuban wrestler Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, the Unified World Wrestling's strict rules resulted in her elimination.  Her performance was seen as a symbol of resilience, particularly in light of the sexual harassment allegations against former Wrestling Federation of India chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, which the Indian contingent faced.  Vinesh's exit, leaving her without a medal despite her extraordinary efforts, has deeply saddened Indian sports fans.

A U.S. court ruled that Google is a monopoly, finding that it violated antitrust laws by using exclusive deals with smartphone manufacturers to maintain its dominance in the online search market. Judge Amit P. Mehta stated that Google's practices stifled competition. 

The Department of Justice is now considering potential remedies, which could range from breaking up Google to eliminating its exclusive agreements with phone makers like Apple and Samsung. These decisions have significant implications for the future of Big Tech, as similar antitrust cases are pending against companies like Meta, Amazon, and Apple.

The Supreme Court ruled that the Lt. Governor of Delhi holds independent authority in appointing aldermen to the Delhi Municipal Corporation. This decision, based on the law governing Centre-Delhi relations and previous judgments, underscores the Delhi government's vulnerability to central influence. 

The Court clarified that the Lt. Governor's power to appoint individuals with special knowledge in municipal administration isn't subject to the advice of the Delhi Council of Ministers. This power, rooted in the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, stands apart from the general rule that the Lt. Governor acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers on most matters. This ruling highlights the potential for conflict between the elected government and the appointed administrator. 

While the Constitution Bench attempted to establish a framework for resolving disagreements, the Centre ultimately retains the final say in Delhi's governance due to Parliament's power to legislate and amend laws pertaining to matters under the Delhi Assembly's jurisdiction.

Puja Khedkar's case exposes a deeply flawed system within the Union Public Service Commission recruitment process.  Khedkar used multiple deceptions, including faking a disability and community certificate, to secure a position she wouldn't have otherwise obtained. Her actions highlight a systemic vulnerability where impersonation and manipulation can easily undermine the fairness of competitive examinations.  The government must address this by overhauling the entire examination system, ensuring robust measures to detect fraud and protect the integrity of the process.  This incident also raises concerns about the disability certification process, demanding a review to safeguard genuine applicants and prevent exploitation.

Sheikh Hasina, ousted Prime Minister of Bangladesh, narrowly escaped mob violence following months of student protests.  A once beloved leader credited with economic progress and fighting terrorism, Hasina faced growing resentment over alleged vote rigging, suppression of dissent, and politically motivated arrests. 

The student protests, triggered by quota system issues, ignited a wider anger stemming from years of curtailing democratic processes. Hasina's hardline approach alienated even those who had previously supported her, including Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.

Hasina’s forced exit raises concerns about the potential influence of Islamist groups and the future of Bangladesh’s secularism.

After President Biden's unexpected withdrawal from the race, Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic nominee to challenge former President Donald Trump in the November election. Harris, who secured a majority of party votes, has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.  Despite her late entry, she has gained a slight lead in national polls and raised a significant amount of campaign funds. 

The Trump campaign, having previously focused its attacks on Biden, is now pivoting to criticize Harris, resorting to disparaging language and questioning her racial identity. This strategy may inadvertently benefit Harris, allowing her to appeal to a broader electorate and potentially construct a more inclusive policy agenda. The world, seeking stability and democratic values, will be watching closely as the election unfolds.

The assassinations of Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran have significantly escalated tensions in the West Asia region. While Israel claims responsibility for Shukr's death, it hasn't confirmed its involvement in Haniyeh's killing. These incidents follow the already tense situation along Israel's northern border with Lebanon, leading to rocket exchanges between Hezbollah and the Israeli Defense Forces. The killings raise concerns about Iranian retaliation against Israel, potentially triggering a larger conflict.  Haniyeh's death is particularly concerning as he was a moderate voice within Hamas and was involved in ceasefire negotiations with Israel.  Israel's actions, seen as blatant provocations, risk drawing the US into a regional war.

Manu Bhaker's historic bronze medal wins in the 10m air pistol and mixed 10m air pistol events at the Paris Olympics marked a resurgence for Indian shooting. Bhaker's success followed a period of drought in the sport after a string of medals in previous Olympic Games. 

Her achievements highlight the progress made in Indian shooting, building upon the early pioneering efforts of shooters like Anjali Bhagwat and Suma Shirur. The support system, including coaching from experienced figures like Jaspal Rana, has played a crucial role in nurturing young talent. Bhaker's performance, along with Swapnil Kusale's bronze and Arjun Babuta's fourth-place finish, demonstrated the capability of Indian shooters on the world stage.

India's core infrastructure sectors saw growth slow to a 20-month low of 4% in June.  

This slowdown was attributed to reduced state spending on public works following the general election and persistent heatwaves that dampened economic activity. Sectors like refinery products, electricity generation, and steel experienced contractions or significant decelerations in growth. However, coal production expanded at a robust pace. 

A private survey indicated that broader manufacturing activity eased slightly in July, but input costs surged, prompting manufacturers to raise selling prices at their fastest rate in over a decade, raising concerns about inflationary pressures.

Amendments to Uttar Pradesh's anti-conversion law aim to increase jail terms for those convicted of "unlawful conversion."  The law, originally enacted in 2021, has been used to prosecute over 400 cases primarily concerning inter-faith marriages. 

The amended law includes harsher bail provisions,  similar to those in the NDPS and PMLA Acts, and expands the possibility of filing a complaint against alleged conversions to anyone, not just the victim or their family. This raises concerns about misuse by communal organizations targeting interfaith relationships.  Critics argue the law criminalizes interfaith marriages and violates fundamental rights.

The Supreme Court has ruled that Scheduled Castes (SCs) can be sub-classified to provide preferential treatment to weaker sections. This decision overturns a 2005 judgment that prohibited states from modifying the SC list. 

The court acknowledged the diversity within SCs and recognized that historical and social disadvantages vary. States can now identify and grant benefits to the most backward groups within SCs. The verdict also addressed the "creamy layer" concept, suggesting its potential application to SCs, although specific norms remain to be determined. The focus remains on ensuring adequate representation for the most marginalized Dalit communities.

Nicolas Maduro won Venezuela's recent presidential election with 51% of the vote, extending his rule for another six years. However, the opposition, claiming widespread irregularities and a stolen vote, reports their candidate Edmundo González won by a significant margin. 

Anti-Maduro protests erupted following the official results which the opposition rejects. Maduro's victory comes amidst a devastating economic crisis that has seen Venezuela's economy contract by 80% in a decade, with extreme poverty and household poverty reaching 53% and 82% respectively.  

The crisis is attributed to factors including falling oil prices, sanctions, and Maduro's policies. Despite the opposition's allegations, Maduro has denied fraud. The US and some Latin American allies have called for transparency but Maduro still enjoys military support.

The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has reportedly withheld the latest draft of the Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2023, from public consultation. While an earlier draft was circulated publicly, the current version is only being shared with select stakeholders under confidentiality agreements. This approach raises concerns as it excludes online creators, parts of the media industry, and civil society, who are heavily impacted by media regulations. The Bill potentially strengthens an existing regulatory framework already criticized for discouraging free expression. The lack of transparency and limited stakeholder engagement raises questions about the government's intent and the potential for the Bill to be exclusionary and flawed.

The Supreme Court of India delivered a split verdict on the approval of genetically modified (GM) mustard, DMH-11. While Justice Nagarathna found the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC)'s approval violated the precautionary principle, Justice Karol supported the GEAC's process. 

The case, which arose from a dispute between developers and environmentalists over the crop's potential environmental impact, will now be heard by a larger Bench. Notably, the Court ordered the government to formulate a comprehensive policy on GM crops.  This highlights the ongoing debate surrounding GM technology in India, which is influenced by both scientific and ideological considerations.

Deadly landslides in Kerala's Wayanad district, triggered by heavy monsoon rains, have claimed over 200 lives. While landslides are common during this season, their intensity and fatalities are unprecedented. Contributing factors include exacerbated river flow due to deforestation and weakened upstream soil stability from previous heavy rains. 

The tragedy highlights the compounding effects of climate change and inadequate disaster preparedness.  The state's vulnerability to landslides in ecologically sensitive areas, exacerbated by excessive rain and development, necessitates a shift in land use practices and increased environmental protection measures.  Failure to heed warnings and implement proper measures risks more devastating consequences in the future.

The Indian government aims to collaborate with the private sector to explore small modular reactors (SMRs) as a potential source of nuclear energy. SMRs are smaller, potentially safer, and more cost-effective than traditional reactors. 

However, challenges remain in ensuring the commercial viability of SMRs, including addressing proliferation concerns and managing the significant amount of plutonium produced. 

The success of SMRs in India will depend on factors such as stable grids, market conditions, mass production capabilities, and the cost of safety and proliferation measures.

### [Option or stratagem?: On Governors, powers and Bills](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/option-or-stratagem-on-governors-powers-and-bills/article68464847.ece)

The article discusses the controversial actions of some Governors in handling legislation passed by state legislatures. Following Supreme Court interventions in Punjab, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana, Governors have increasingly sent disapproved Bills to the President for consideration, bypassing the state legislatures.  

This practice raises concerns about the misuse of the provision for presidential assent, effectively giving the Centre a veiled veto over state laws, something not intended by the Constitution. Kerala's legal challenge against the Governor's actions in this regard highlights the potential subversion of federalism. 


The article emphasizes the Supreme Court's prior rulings in the Punjab and Telangana cases, where the court clarified the Governor's limited power and obligation to act promptly on Bills.  Despite these rulings,  the Governors of West Bengal and Kerala continue to send Bills to the President, raising questions about their adherence to constitutional principles.

### [​Impatience with jobs: On the Budget speech](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bimpatience-with-jobs-on-the-budget-speech/article68464869.ece)

The recent Union Budget prioritizes employment, with a ₹2 lakh crore package aimed at supporting 4.1 crore youth.  

This includes three incentive schemes encouraging hiring of fresh entrants and incentives for companies to scale up their workforce. The government also plans to revamp 1,000 industrial training institutes and launch a large-scale internship program. The focus on tackling unemployment acknowledges a significant concern highlighted by the Opposition. This initiative aims to address the issue of jobless growth, partly caused by investor preference for capital-intensive investments and outdated labor laws.  Success will require more government action, including filling existing vacancies and stimulating consumption, crucial for private sector growth and hiring.

### [Human failure: On IAS aspirants and the accident in Delhi](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/human-failure-the-hindu-editorial-on-ias-aspirants-and-the-accident-in-delhi/article68460733.ece)

The fatal flooding at an IAS coaching centre in New Delhi highlights the increasing risk of localized urban flooding, often caused by human error.  Basements in buildings, particularly those without proper ventilation and access, are particularly vulnerable. While Indian building bylaws generally prohibit habitation in basements, they are often used for other purposes, such as offices or classrooms, due to rising land and building costs. The Delhi Master Plan 2021 mandates clearance from fire authorities for basement use in coaching centres, but it remains unclear if the affected centre obtained the necessary permissions. The incident raises concerns about poor civic infrastructure and enforcement of building regulations.  


Resilient building design, including flood barriers and non-return valves, can mitigate these risks.

A rocket attack on a football ground in Majdal Shams, resulting in the death of 12 young people, has heightened tensions in the region. Israel and the U.S. accuse Hezbollah of the attack, though the group denies involvement. This incident follows on from a series of rocket attacks by Hezbollah from southern Lebanon, targeting Israeli military outposts, in response to the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.  Both sides, while cautious initially,  are now on alert. This escalation risks wider conflict, potentially drawing in Iran, given Hezbollah's strong ties with Iran.  A 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah resulted in significant damage for Israel. Both sides need to de-escalate tensions and prioritize peace, starting with an end to the conflict in Gaza.

The 9th Governing Council meeting of the NITI Aayog saw seven Chief Ministers boycott the event, protesting the perceived lack of allocations and projects for their States in the Union Budget. This, along with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s walkout, raises concerns about NITI Aayog’s effectiveness and its transition from the Planning Commission. 

Critics argue that by relegating itself to an advisory body without resource allocation powers, NITI Aayog has fostered "competitive federalism" and limited consultations with States on grants and projects. Furthermore, the BJP's "double engine" slogan during elections, emphasizing investments in BJP-ruled States, has exacerbated these concerns. The NITI Aayog is urged to regain some of the Planning Commission's responsibilities concerning States to achieve a more cooperative federalism.

### [Plastic mess: On India’s waste problem](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/plastic-mess-on-indias-waste-problem/article68457840.ece)

India faces a massive plastic waste problem, generating 4 million tonnes annually. While the Plastic Waste Management Rules mandate recycling through an extended producer responsibility (EPR) system, issues with fraud and security threats have emerged.   

The EPR system, involving certificates for recycled plastic, saw an estimated 3.7 million tonnes claimed in 2022-23, but  600,000 certificates were identified as fraudulent. To address this, the CPCB is auditing registered recyclers and improving the platform's security. While necessary, such audits should be infrequent to maintain trust in the system. The effectiveness of EPR alone is limited, highlighting the need to reduce plastic production and promote sustainable alternatives. Tackling the root causes of plastic waste and strengthening recycling infrastructure are crucial for India to manage its plastic pollution effectively.

This article discusses the increasing death toll in Gaza as a result of the Israeli Defence Force's (IDF) campaign.  The author highlights the severity of the humanitarian crisis, with widespread displacement, injuries, and lack of essential resources.  Despite international condemnation and calls for a ceasefire, the IDF continues its operations. The article criticizes the U.S. for its unwavering political and military support for Israel, despite the mounting civilian casualties.   While acknowledging U.S. government concerns, the author points to Washington's inaction and continued military aid.  The article concludes by noting growing public dissent and erosion of national consensus in the U.S. on its support for Israel's actions.

### [Fiscal federalism: On taxing mineral rights](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-sc-judgment-on-taxing-mining-activities-fiscal-federalism/article68450896.ece)

The Supreme Court ruled that states have the power to tax mineral rights and mineral-bearing lands, overturning a long-held belief that Parliament's Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act of 1957 preempted this power. 

The court determined that the 1957 Act's royalty provisions are not taxes but contractual considerations. This decision significantly expands states' revenue-generating potential and strengthens their fiscal autonomy.  

However, dissenting Justice B.V. Nagarathna raised concerns about potential negative consequences, including state-level competition, price volatility, and exploitation of the national market.

The 2024-25 Union Budget demonstrates a blend of financial planning and political strategy. While emphasizing national priorities like agriculture and employment, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman  allocated significant funds to Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, states led by parties crucial to the BJP's post-election coalition.  

Bihar received nearly ₹59,000 crore, including infrastructure and power sector investments. Andhra Pradesh received ₹15,000 crore for its new capital's development.  Critics argue this approach favors states with political ties over those that contribute significantly to the national revenue, potentially hindering development in economically advanced states with high-tech industries.

The 2024 Paris Olympics, beginning Friday, mark a return to a sense of normalcy after the pandemic-disrupted Tokyo Games. While Russia is banned due to the war in Ukraine, individual athletes will compete neutrally. This edition highlights global complexities, with Israel participating despite criticism over its handling of the Palestinian issue. 

The Games showcase athletic excellence, featuring traditional powerhouses like the US, China, and Japan, alongside smaller nations vying for upsets. From established stars like Rafael Nadal to emerging talents, the Olympics capture global attention. The inclusion of breakdancing reflects the evolving landscape of sport and entertainment.  Beyond competition, the Games offer hope and a stage for nations to unite, even amidst global challenges like security concerns and the lingering impact of COVID-19.

The Supreme Court of India has ruled on a disputed physics question in the NEET 2024 exam, reducing the number of toppers from 61 to 17.  The court, based on expert opinion from IIT Delhi, declared only one answer as correct, leading to a five-mark deduction for 4 lakh students, including those who topped the exam. The ruling came after concerns were raised about an unusually high number of toppers this year. While counselling has been delayed due to the score revision, the court's decision aims to restore faith in the exam's integrity.

The Supreme Court has temporarily halted directives from Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand governments requiring food stalls along the Kanwar Yatra route to display owner and employee identification.  

Petitioners argued that this would lead to discriminatory consequences and undermine the country's secular nature. The Court issued notices to states along the pilgrimage route, including Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, and Madhya Pradesh, and will hear the case further on Friday. The Kanwar Yatra, a significant pilgrimage for Shiva devotees, sees participants walking hundreds of kilometers carrying water from the Ganges River to temples.

This year's Union Budget, presented by Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, focuses heavily on addressing youth unemployment.  
A ₹2 lakh crore package proposes five schemes to  benefit 4.1 crore youth over five years. 

This includes a subsidy for first-time formal sector employees, incentive support for job creation in manufacturing,  and a skilling program leveraging ITIs.  
The Budget also aims to facilitate internships for 1 crore youth in 500 top companies.

Acknowledging  concerns about the MSME sector, the government offers credit guarantee schemes and seeks to simplify GST and the tax structure. 
Additionally, there are tax reliefs for salaried individuals and pensioners. 

To achieve fiscal consolidation, spending on social sectors, including MGNREGA, has been reduced, along with subsidies.
  Political compulsions led to increased allocations for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh.

President Joe Biden has unexpectedly withdrawn from the 2024 US presidential race, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor.  The decision, made just four months before the election, comes amidst pressure from Democrats concerned about Biden's age and public performance. Harris is now the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, making her a likely candidate to become the first person of colour and first woman of Indian origin to run for president. While she faces challenges such as lower national recognition and criticism from Republicans, she enjoys access to campaign funds and benefits from being next in line for the presidency. The Democratic party is expected to rally around Harris as she seeks to secure the nomination and challenge Republican candidate Donald Trump in the crucial swing states.

Violent protests in Bangladesh against its contentious job quota system, which led to 163 deaths, highlighted the strain on the relationship between the government and civil society. Though triggered by a High Court ruling to reinstate the old quota system, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's response exacerbated the situation.  She labelled protesters as "Razakars," an offensive term associated with collaborators during the 1971 war, and allegedly tolerated attacks on them by her party’s student wing.  

The Supreme Court eventually reduced the quota, providing a victory for the protesters.   fuelled by both economic hardship and political discontent.  Government jobs are highly sought after given high youth unemployment, and the quota system is seen as benefiting the ruling Awami League.  


  The situation emphasizes the need for the government to engage in dialogue with protesters and opposition leaders to find lasting solutions, investigate the deaths, and address Bangladesh's unemployment crisis.

A recent software glitch highlighted global reliance on information technology, causing widespread disruption to services like banking, healthcare, and transportation. 

While technological advancements are crucial, the article emphasizes the need for robust failsafes and emergency protocols to mitigate the impact of such failures. It argues that the interconnected nature of these technologies necessitates a more proactive approach from governments, particularly in managing digital privacy, data sovereignty, and building resilient infrastructure. The article cites the example of electronic voting machines to underscore the importance of transparency and public trust in technology, calling for measures like open-source software and rigorous integrity testing.

Mirabai Chanu and Lovlina Borgohain, both aiming for consecutive medals in weightlifting and boxing respectively, also hold strong potential. Other key athletes include Nikhat Zareen, Amit Panghal, Antim Panghal, and Vinesh Phogat in boxing and wrestling. The Indian hockey team, aiming to build on its Tokyo bronze, will look to make a significant impact.

The Karnataka government's draft bill proposing local reservation in industries sparked controversy and was later withdrawn.  Despite prior court rulings deeming such attempts unconstitutional, the bill aimed to reserve 50% of management and 70% of non-management positions for local candidates.  

This move was criticized for violating fundamental rights and creating artificial barriers to employment based on residency.

Similar laws in Haryana and Andhra Pradesh have also faced legal challenges, with the Haryana law being quashed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court.  The Karnataka government's intent, possibly driven by resident worker resentment towards migrant workers, overlooks the potential for ensuring equal labor rights and protections for all workers, instead of resorting to protectionist measures.

The Republican National Convention, held for the first time in person since 2020, solidified former President Donald Trump's control over the party. 

Trump, recovering from a recent assassination attempt, delivered his first public speech since the incident.  The convention featured a noticeable emphasis on female political power, a potential strategy to counter Trump's past controversies regarding women. Trump's selection of 39-year-old J.D. Vance as his running mate is seen as an attempt to appeal to younger voters, white male America, and secure support in crucial swing states of the Rust Belt. 

While Trump holds a strong lead in national polls, the presidential race still has three months to unfold.

A recently tabled Maharashtra bill aimed at combating left-wing extremism raises concerns about its necessity and constitutionality. Critics argue that existing laws are sufficient to address this limited issue within the state.  

The bill's vaguely defined terms, such as "urban Naxal" and "unlawful activity," could be used to target lawful dissent, lawyers, and human rights activists. Provisions allowing for the declaration of organizations as unlawful and for severe penalties against members and supporters raise alarm bells.  

The bill's power to seize assets and evict occupants from buildings associated with alleged unlawful activity further amplifies these concerns, potentially violating individual rights.

India's June goods exports reached $35.2 billion, marking the third consecutive month of growth. Imports, though up 5% at $56.2 billion, were lower than May's peak. The trade deficit widened 9.4% year-on-year. A significant concern remains the oil deficit, which narrowed to $10 billion but still represents almost half of the first quarter trade deficit. While gold imports fell, silver imports surged.  Gems and jewellery exports continued their decline. The government is urged to address the bullion market disruptions and the export slump in this sector.

Two Supreme Court observations regarding arrests under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) highlight concerns about personal liberty. 

The court questioned whether arresting officers under PMLA must demonstrate the necessity for an arrest, as the law only requires "reason to believe" the person is guilty. It emphasized that arrests should not be arbitrary and that officers must consider both incriminating and exonerating evidence. 

The court also expressed concern over the frequent staying of bail orders granted by lower courts, urging higher courts to be cautious about interfering with reasoned decisions and only intervene in exceptional cases.

The need for solutions is emphasized, with suggestions ranging from a robot tax to incentivize job creation to a renewed focus on public and cooperative investment in agriculture. The government is urged to  collaborate across sectors and political divides to prioritize job creation in its economic growth strategy,  learning from global experiences where employment stagnation can lead to social and political instability.

India's consumer inflation unexpectedly accelerated to 5.08% in June, driven primarily by a surge in food prices. The Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) rose 9.36% year-on-year, with eight of its nine sub-categories showing sequential price increases.  

Vegetables, driven by high prices for potatoes, onions, and tomatoes, experienced the most significant price gains. The outlook for food prices remains uncertain, with continued high prices for key staples like rice and wheat, and a monsoon deficit in some key food-growing regions, including Punjab. This volatile food price situation poses a challenge for monetary policymakers attempting to control inflation.

Argentina, led by Lionel Messi, secured its 16th Copa America crown after a nail-biting victory in penalties. 

The tournaments featured electrifying performances from young stars, captivating fans with high-tempo attacking football. While some reigning champions fell short, veterans like Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo continue to inspire.

Carlos Alcaraz's victory over Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon marks a significant shift in the tennis landscape. The win solidifies Alcaraz's positioning as the new king of the sport, especially as it's his second consecutive win against Djokovic. This achievement comes at a time when the dominance of the Big Three (Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic) is waning, as the past three Grand Slams have been won by players outside of this group.

Alcaraz's all-around game and mental strength have propelled him to success across all surfaces, evident in his wins on clay, hard, and grass. While other talented players like Jannik Sinner and Daniil Medvedev are rising, Alcaraz stands out as the most complete player of his generation.

INDIA bloc parties secured victory in 10 out of 13 Assembly by-polls across seven states, mirroring the trend observed in the recent Lok Sabha elections. The results suggest a growing resistance against the BJP. Notably, Congress regained its full strength in Himachal Pradesh, rejecting the defection of previous Congress members who joined the BJP. Similar rejection of defectors was seen in Uttarakhand. 

While some defectors were successful, like in Madhya Pradesh, the results highlight a trend where opportunism is being questioned by the electorate.

Nepal's Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal lost a trust vote, marking yet another shift in the country's volatile political landscape. Dahal's Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) had formed the government after the 2022 elections despite finishing third, relying on alliances that constantly shifted. The Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) led by Khadka Prasad Oli withdrew support, joining forces with the Nepali Congress to install Oli as the new Prime Minister in a power-sharing arrangement with Sher Bahadur Deuba.  This instability has plagued Nepal since its transition to democracy, leading to poor governance and hindering progress despite constitutional reforms.  The pursuit of power appears to drive coalition politics more than ideology, leaving the Nepali people disillusioned with the democratic process.

Prime Minister Modi's visit to Russia, his first since the Ukraine war, was framed as a bilateral effort despite attracting global attention.  The visit saw reaffirmation of India-Russia ties and a focus on strengthening economic and trade relations, with a target of $100 billion bilateral trade by 2030. Despite the war in Ukraine and Western sanctions, India significantly increased its oil imports from Russia. 

Modi's visit lacked announcements of new military purchases, potentially due to delays and international pressure. His statement emphasizing the absence of a "battlefield solution" to the conflict and subsequent trip to Vienna were attempts to balance the visit. 

The timing, coinciding with Ukraine's missile attacks and the NATO summit condemning Russia's actions, drew criticism from Kyiv and Washington, presenting a challenge for India to manage its relationships with the West.

A recent bus accident in Uttar Pradesh, killing 18 people, highlights the critical need for comprehensive road safety measures in India. Investigations suggest the bus lacked safety features like an alarm system and had an expired insurance policy, emphasizing the importance of rigorous enforcement of existing standards. Road safety is a multi-faceted issue encompassing road design, speed control, and vehicle safety.  

The high number of road accident fatalities in India, estimated by IIT Delhi to be 11.3 per lakh population in 2021, signals a public health crisis.  The Ministry of Road Transport and Highways must improve data collection and reporting on vehicle safety, while local authorities need to enforce safety standards more effectively and prevent dilution of these standards. Increased public awareness about vehicle safety standards is also crucial.

The Supreme Court has ruled that a divorced Muslim woman can seek maintenance under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), reaffirming her right to a secular remedy. This ruling clarifies the impact of the Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act, 1986, which had previously been interpreted to limit her options. The Court emphasized that the 1986 Act, codifying rights within Muslim personal law, does not negate a woman's right to seek maintenance under the CrPC, which focuses on preventing vagrancy among women. The verdict upholds the principle of harmonious interpretation, ensuring both personal law provisions and secular remedies coexist for divorced Muslim women.

The Supreme Court has rescheduled a hearing to address these complaints, while the Centre is relying on an IIT Madras report analyzing the results. The report claims no evidence of mass malpractice but acknowledges an overall increase in student scores attributed to a syllabus reduction. Despite these claims, student outrage persists, and public trust in the exam has been significantly eroded. To restore confidence, transparent engagement with students, public acknowledgement of errors, and improved processes are crucial.

The Governor of West Bengal, C.V. Ananda Bose, has escalated tensions with the State government by demanding a report on the actions taken against two police officers. Bose alleges the officers made inappropriate remarks regarding an investigation into a sexual harassment complaint filed against him by a Raj Bhavan employee.  The complaint cannot be acted upon due to the Governor's immunity, but Bose believes the officers flouted protocol.  He also criticized the Commissioner for stopping a group with grievances about post-election violence from meeting with him. The Governor's action highlights ongoing conflict between Raj Bhavan and the State government,  raising concerns about the politicisation of the Governor's office.

The Karnataka Platform-based Gig Workers (Social Security and Welfare) Bill, 2024 offers a significant step towards regulating the gig economy in India.  The bill aims to protect gig workers from arbitrary dismissals, provide grievance redress mechanisms, and ensure more transparency in algorithmic practices. 

It establishes a welfare board and fund, with contributions from the government, aggregators, and potentially a transaction-based cess. While this legislation doesn't grant gig workers the status of employees, it acknowledges their rights and provides a safety net through social security.  Fast implementation is crucial, as past efforts in Rajasthan illustrate the vulnerability of such legislation to political shifts. A nationwide comprehensive law encompassing minimum wages, working conditions, and employee status is needed to truly ensure the well-being of India's growing gig workforce.

Five Indian Army personnel were killed in an ambush by terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir's Badnota village on July 8th. This incident, coinciding with the death anniversary of Burhan Wani, marks the latest in a series of attacks, particularly in the Rajouri-Poonch region, signalling a shift in terrorism's focus.  

The attack, described as a new low, follows a June 9th incident where terrorists targeted a bus in Reasi district, killing nine pilgrims. While the region had seen relative peace for over two decades, recent attacks raise concerns about the efficacy of security measures and potential gaps in intelligence. The changing tactics, including the use of local militants and new terror groups, pose fresh challenges to counterterrorism efforts. The situation demands a multi-layered strategy involving swift government action and collaboration with all stakeholders.

On June 8, Russia launched missile strikes across Ukraine, killing at least 42 civilians, including two at the Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospital in Kyiv. Russia claims the strikes targeted military infrastructure, but such claims are dubious given the pattern of attacks on civilian areas. This attack, taking place ahead of a NATO summit, may have been a message to NATO and Poland, which recently signed a security pact with Ukraine.

While Russia has made incremental territorial gains, its  performance raises questions about its capabilities.  Meanwhile, Ukraine has escalated drone warfare, targeting Russian infrastructure and ships.

The war shows no signs of a military solution.  Both sides should engage in serious dialogue, as urged by world leaders like Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Modi.

The Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have taken a positive step towards resolving long-standing issues between the two states.  A three-tier mechanism has been proposed, starting with a committee of administrative officials, followed by a ministerial committee, and finally, intervention by the Chief Ministers.  This move is seen as a departure from the acrimonious relationship that marked the initial years after Telangana's formation, with both leaders committed to prioritizing the well-being of their people. The agreement signifies a renewed focus on cooperation, particularly in areas such as water sharing, asset distribution, and power supply.

France's New Popular Front, a coalition of left-wing parties, emerged as the largest bloc in the recent snap election, securing 182 seats. Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance came second with 168 seats, while Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally secured 143 seats, exceeding expectations.  

The results signify a blow to Macron's political agenda and illustrate rising concerns about the far-right across Europe. The National Rally, led by Jordan Bardella, has adopted a strategy of revising its public image, potentially softening its stance on contentious issues like immigration.  

This shift in public perception has allowed the far-right to gain traction in countries like Italy, Finland, and the Netherlands, posing a significant challenge to the traditional political landscape.

Prime Minister Modi's visit to Moscow underscores the enduring India-Russia partnership, marking the 22nd annual summit. This meeting, the first since the Ukraine war erupted, allows for discussions on bilateral issues like trade, energy, and defense cooperation. The visit also provides an opportunity to address the war's repercussions on global security, food, fuel, and fertilizer supplies, as well as concerns regarding defense deliveries and Indian recruitment by Russia.  Modi's visit comes amidst geopolitical tensions, contrasting  with a NATO summit in Washington focusing on the transatlantic alliance's efforts to counter Russia's isolation.  India's stance, balancing engagement with Russia and support for diplomacy, will be closely watched as Modi seeks to promote dialogue and hasten an end to the conflict.

Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist, has won Iran's presidential election, surprising many who saw the Islamic Republic facing a legitimacy crisis. Pezeshkian, a relatively unknown figure before his candidacy, campaigned on a platform of social reform and engagement with the West, contrasting with the conservative incumbents.  His victory, secured with a near 50% turnout, comes after years of protests and calls for change from a frustrated public. While his powers are limited in Iran's theocratic system, his strong mandate presents an opportunity for gradual reforms and  a potential thawing of relations with the West.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi finally addressed the ongoing conflict in Manipur, acknowledging the crisis while asserting that steps had been taken to restore order. He called for peace and stability, blaming the Congress for past handling of similar incidents and attributing the tensions to deep-rooted social issues.  However, Manipur remains far from normal.  

Displaced people remain unable to return home, government services are disrupted, and armed vigilantes continue to operate.  Central agencies have effectively assumed control,  raising questions about the state government’s capacity to lead.  Despite calls for change in leadership, neither Modi nor Home Minister Amit Shah has indicated any intention to replace Chief Minister N. Biren Singh.  Effective solutions require more than acknowledgments; decisive action and leadership are needed to achieve lasting peace and reconciliation in Manipur.

Keir Starmer's Labour Party achieved a landslide victory in the UK general election, securing 412 seats and granting Starmer a strong mandate to implement his agenda. This victory can be attributed to the Conservative Party's failings over the past 14 years, including mishandling of Brexit, economic struggles, and various scandals. 

Labour's priorities include wealth creation for the working class, higher taxes for the wealthy, phasing out fossil fuel vehicles by 2030, and establishing a new border control agency.  The rise of the far-right Reform UK, with its anti-immigration stance, presents a challenge for Starmer on this issue.  International relations, including the stalled India-UK FTA, will also be key areas of focus for the new Labour government.

The US Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, ruled that presidents have immunity from criminal prosecution for acts considered core constitutional duties.  For other official acts, they have presumptive immunity, and for unofficial acts, no immunity exists. The ruling stemmed from the doctrine of separation of powers and aims to protect the presidency from undue interference.  

While the decision doesn't directly address former President Donald Trump's alleged involvement in the 2020 election interference, it establishes a framework for future prosecutions. Critics argue this creates a dangerous precedent, potentially allowing presidents to act with impunity and violate the law, undermining democratic principles and accountability.

Global efforts to eradicate wild poliovirus type-1 (WPV1) by 2026 face growing challenges. While the total number of WPV1 cases in Pakistan and Afghanistan in 2023 decreased compared to 2022,  a concerning uptick in cases has been observed in early 2024.

Positively, the virus is circulating in areas where immunization campaigns have not achieved the desired coverage. The presence of WPV1 in historical reservoirs in both countries, particularly cities like Karachi, calls for urgent action to prevent further spread. 
The situation is particularly worrisome due to the movement of refugees, which increases the risk of cross-border transmission.

A stampede at a religious gathering in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh, claimed over 120 lives, primarily women and children from vulnerable communities. The incident, which occurred during an address by  preacher Suraj Pal, is attributed to overcrowding as over 2.5 lakh people attended an event with a capacity for 80,000. Reports suggest the stampede was triggered by a rush to collect soil from around the preacher's feet. 

The Uttar Pradesh administration's preparedness has been severely criticized due to inadequate medical response and the absence of sufficient ambulances and staff. The tragedy highlights the lack of proactive measures by authorities despite past incidents. 


The government has vowed immediate action against those responsible and a just compensation package for the victims' families.  The incident underscores the crucial need for effective crowd management strategies and a heightened awareness of safety protocols during large-scale events.

The first session of the 18th Lok Sabha saw a revival of parliamentary debate despite combative exchanges between the government and the Opposition. Rahul Gandhi, the new Leader of Opposition, led an aggressive critique against the NDA government, prompting a rebuttal from Prime Minister Narendra Modi.  

The rise of a strong Opposition with the return of coalition politics could restore Parliament's role, encouraging greater scrutiny of Bills and acting as a check on the government's legislative agenda. After the tumultuous 17th Lok Sabha, the formation of the new Lok Sabha showcased  an effort to revive parliamentary traditions. Both sides emphasized their commitment to the Constitution, albeit while accusing each other of undermining it. 


The Speaker and Chairman of both Houses face pressure to remain impartial, particularly concerning expunging portions of speeches from the record.

### [Mixed signals: On data and the key industrial sectors](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/mixed-signals-on-data-and-the-key-industrial-sectors/article68359646.ece)

India's core infrastructure sectors saw a slowdown in May due to the impact of a heatwave. While coal and electricity generation saw double-digit growth, other sectors like crude oil, fertilizers, and cement experienced negative growth or a deceleration. The heatwave hindered construction activity, leading to a decline in cement and steel output.  A fifth consecutive month of contraction in fertilizer production raises concerns about the agricultural sector.  

However, a private sector survey suggests that manufacturing activity rebounded in June, driven by increased output, buying, and hiring. This growth is accompanied by rising input and transportation costs, pushing manufacturers to raise prices. Despite the rebound, inflationary pressures and declining confidence in future output signal ongoing economic challenges.

The 2024 Wimbledon Championships mark a significant transition in tennis with the retiremenet of Federer and Nadal's absence, signalling the end of an era dominated by the "Big Four".  

Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray, both battling injuries, are competing in a limited capacity. This opens the door for a new generation of players to shine. Carlos Alcaraz, the reigning Wimbledon champion, and Jannik Sinner, who boasts a recent Australian Open title and grass-court victory in Halle, stand out as strong contenders. 

The women's field is equally intriguing. While Iga Swiatek holds the No.1 ranking, her grass-court performance needs to be proven. Coco Gauff, with her young talent, and the absence of Aryna Sabalenka create a wide-open race for the title.

Three new criminal laws, replacing the Indian Penal Code, Code of Criminal Procedure, and Indian Evidence Act, have come into force in India. Concerns have been raised about the preparedness of the police and judiciary to implement these laws, with limited training and awareness programs reported. 

There's criticism over the names of the laws being exclusively in Hindi and the lack of extensive public debate before their enactment.  Some provisions, like the expanded police custody powers and the inclusion of 'terrorism' as an ordinary crime, have raised concerns about potential misuse. 


The government maintains that states can amend the laws, but  the overall impact and potential for confusion remain uncertain.

Iran will hold a runoff election on July 5th between reformist Masoud Pezeshkian and conservative Saeed Jalili after neither candidate secured 50% of the vote in the first round. Pezeshkian, a former health minister, garnered 42.5%, while Jalili, a former nuclear negotiator, received 38.8%.  The election, necessitated by President Raisi's death, occurs amidst economic challenges, social discontent, and international pressure.

Despite the upcoming election, it's unlikely that a new president, whether reformist or conservative, will significantly alter Iran's core policies. The country's political system, tightly controlled by the clergy, presents significant limitations on potential reforms. Low voter turnout reflects public apathy and dissatisfaction with the status quo.

India won the ICC T20 World Cup in Barbados, ending their long drought in ICC tournaments.  They defeated a determined South Africa by seven runs in the final. Virat Kohli's 76 runs and excellent bowling from Jasprit Bumrah and Arshdeep Singh proved crucial for India. South Africa fought hard but came up short. This victory marks the end of an era for India, with Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja, and coach Rahul Dravid retiring from T20Is.  Afghanistan's journey to the semifinals was a heartwarming story of resilience.

The Jharkhand High Court granted bail to former Chief Minister Hemant Soren, who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The court, questioning the ED's case, highlighted inconsistencies and a lack of evidence to support claims of money laundering.

The court focused on the ED's assertion that Soren planned to build a banquet hall on land suspected to be acquired illegally. It pointed out the absence of any legal action by those allegedly evicted from the land and challenged the ED's reliance on a consultant's plan found on an accused person's phone. 

The judgment underscores concerns about the misuse of PMLA to target political opponents and raises questions about the speed at which arrests are made based on inferences and assumptions.

The GST Council, meeting for the first time in nine months, addressed numerous industry concerns and taxpayer grievances.  Key decisions include GST exemption for hostel accommodation under ₹20,000 per month and railway travel services for passengers.  A uniform 12% GST rate was set for packing cartons, milk cans, and solar cookers, simplifying classification.  The Council also extended a waiver for interest and penalty on tax dues for the first three years of GST, provided they are settled by March 2025. 


Other changes include the elimination of the anti-profiteering clause and the implementation of Aadhaar-based authentication for GST registrations. The Council plans to further review and rationalize the GST rate structure in its upcoming August meeting.

Kenyan President William Ruto faced public backlash and violence after attempting to fast-track an IMF-backed finance bill that proposed significant tax increases. The bill, which aimed to raise $1.55 billion, ignited protests resulting in at least 23 deaths and 200 injuries.  

Ruto ultimately withdrew the bill, acknowledging public discontent. The government justified the tax increases as necessary to address Kenya's massive debt burden, which reached $80 billion last year. 

Critics argue that Kenya's reliance on external loans for infrastructure projects, coupled with the global economic downturn and rising interest rates, has created a financial crisis that disproportionately affects the poor. The situation highlights the need for sustainable development models and debt relief for African nations.

The arrest of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal by the CBI in the Delhi excise policy corruption case is seen as politically motivated.  The timing of the arrest, just before the Supreme Court was set to hear an appeal regarding Kejriwal's bail in a related money-laundering case, raises concerns. While the accusation of Kejriwal benefiting from the controversial excise policy is serious, the investigation has been ongoing for two years with limited concrete evidence. The back-and-forth legal battles over bail highlight the politicization of the judicial system and cast doubt on the impartiality of the investigation. As the case progresses, it remains to be seen if the CBI can substantiate its allegations against Kejriwal.

The post-ban resumption of fishing off India's eastern coast led to a deadly incident involving the Sri Lankan Navy chasing Indian trawlers. The incident resulted in the impoundment of a trawler and the arrest of 10 fishermen (8 from Tamil Nadu, 2 from Andhra Pradesh).  

The Tamil Nadu Chief Minister requested intervention from the Indian External Affairs Minister for the release of the fishermen and their vessel. This incident highlights the ongoing maritime dispute between India and Sri Lanka regarding fishing rights. Both countries need to revive negotiations and find a solution that addresses the livelihood of fishermen while protecting the marine environment.  Alternatives like deep sea fishing, marine cage farming, seaweed cultivation, and sea ranching need to be explored and supported to help shift away from bottom trawling.

The article revisits the Emergency imposed in 1975,  criticizing its infringement on civil liberties and democratic principles. 

While condemning the Emergency, the Lok Sabha Speaker's recent actions, including suspending Opposition MPs, are seen as contradictory and hypocritical. The article argues that the BJP's government has employed similar tactics to stifle dissent, resorting to attacks on free press, selective targeting of Opposition members, and draconian laws to detain individuals. It concludes that a robust Opposition, a vigilant judiciary, and a committed civil society are crucial for India to truly move past the legacy of the Emergency and prevent its recurrence.

The defection of MLA M. Sanjay Kumar from the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) to the ruling Congress in Telangana has reduced the Opposition's strength in the Assembly.  Defections have plagued Indian politics since 2014, with Telangana witnessing significant defections during K Chandrashekhar Rao's first term as Chief Minister. The 10th Schedule of the Anti-Defection Law allows for exceptions if two-thirds of a party member merges with another, hindering its effectiveness.

The current defection has caused tension within the Congress, especially as it involves the candidate who lost the Jagtial Assembly seat. This incident highlights the need to strengthen the anti-defection law, possibly by vesting the power to decide disqualifications with an independent Election Commission, to uphold democratic principles and ensure a robust Opposition.

Prime Minister Modi has called for consensus in governing, despite  evident tension between the NDA and the INDIA bloc. Both sides reiterate their commitment to the Constitution, but concrete displays of collaboration remain absent.  The first session highlighted this divide,  with disagreements over the pro tem Speaker and the upcoming Speaker’s election. While the Opposition has offered support for the NDA’s candidate in exchange for the Deputy Speaker's position, the BJP remains non-committal.  Modi's rhetoric on consensus and parliamentary debate holds promise, but   tangible action is needed.  Building coalitions and fostering constructive engagement between the ruling party and the opposition are crucial for India's progress.

Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, is to be released after a plea deal in a US espionage case. He will plead guilty and be sentenced to five years, the time he has already served in detention. 

Assange was arrested in 2010 on European charges of sex crimes, which were later dropped. He then sought asylum in the Ecuador embassy, only to be extradited to the UK and then face US charges in 2019 for publishing classified documents.  

While his release is a victory for his supporters, concerns remain about the precedent set by convicting a journalist for publishing classified information and the lengthy persecution he endured.

Despite a year passing since ethnic violence erupted in Manipur, the state remains volatile. The conflict has spread to previously peaceful districts, fueled by the proliferation of armed militias wielding looted weapons. The federal government's attempts to maintain peace through indirect means of Article 355 and the current leadership, while prioritizing security briefings, have proven ineffective. 

The recent general election results, where the Congress party achieved a decisive victory despite intimidation tactics, underscore the people's dissatisfaction with the status quo. Urgent action is needed to disarm militias, empower peace-building civil society organizations, and foster reconciliation between ethnic groups. A leadership change is essential, accompanied by a genuine commitment to addressing the root causes of the conflict and restoring normalcy to Manipur.

The Union Tribal Affairs Ministry is reviewing forest clearance documents for the ₹72,000-crore Great Nicobar Project, a controversial initiative that involves substantial infrastructure development on the island.  The project, facing criticism for its potential environmental and social impact, aims to build a port, airport, township, and power plant, potentially affecting over 130 sq. km of pristine forest and home to rare species. While the government highlights strategic advantages, critics point to tourism as a key driver.  Lack of transparency surrounding the environmental clearance process and concerns over tribal consent have prompted scrutiny from the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes and the National Green Tribunal.

The Patna High Court has struck down Bihar's enhanced reservation policy, citing the 50% ceiling limit set by judiciary precedent. The court invalidated the government's amendments, which raised reservations for Backward Classes, Extremely Backward Communities, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes.  

The government's attempt to justify the increased quotas based on caste-wise population figures and the state's social backwardness was rejected. While acknowledging the need for social justice, the court stressed the constitutional limit on reservations, even when special circumstances are argued.

The upcoming by-election in Vikravandi, Tamil Nadu has taken an unusual turn with the AIADMK boycotting the poll. Citing concerns about potential misuse of money and muscle power, the AIADMK, which suffered a significant defeat in the 2024 general election, may be attempting to avoid another loss and potentially wooing back the PMK.  The boycott raises questions about the seriousness of the opposition and puts pressure on the Election Commission of India (ECI) to ensure a free and fair election. 

Concerns about bribery persist, and the ECI's role in enforcing existing laws against electoral offenses is crucial. The ECI's past actions, while strong in some instances, have been inconsistent, prompting calls for a clear message against bribery and the influence of money in elections.

### [Testing times: On the need to mend the National Testing Agency](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/testing-times-on-the-need-to-mend-the-national-testing-agency/article68316647.ece)

The cancellation of the UGC-NET exam following allegations of irregularities has further damaged the National Testing Agency (NTA)'s credibility. This incident, coupled with controversies surrounding NEET-UG and JEE exams, places the NTA under intense scrutiny.  The government's swift action in cancelling the UGC-NET and initiating a CBI probe contrasts with its handling of the NEET paper leak issue.  The reversal to an offline exam format for UGC-NET raises questions about vulnerability to leaks. 

Full transparency, accountability for those responsible, and a potential overhaul of NTA's systems are crucial to restore public trust.  The NTA's troubles have become politicized, with some demanding its dismantling and a return of examination responsibility to the states.
