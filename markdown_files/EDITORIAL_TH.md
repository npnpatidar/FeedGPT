India's retail inflation edged up to 3.65% in August, driven by a sharp rebound in vegetable prices, which surged over 380 basis points to 10.7%. Food inflation accelerated to 5.66%, with prices of potatoes and onions still exhibiting high double-digit inflation. Disinflation in pulses and cereals remained slow, posing a challenge to achieving durable disinflation.  Core inflation, excluding food and fuel, also inched up to 3.38%, indicating a resurgence in underlying price pressures. The spatial and temporal volatility of the monsoon further complicates the outlook for price stability, leaving policymakers with a challenge to ensure inflation doesn't undermine economic momentum.

The Union Cabinet has approved Mission Mausam, a ₹2,000 crore project aimed at enhancing India's weather and climate forecasting capabilities. The mission will upgrade instruments at various meteorological organizations, including weather radars, wind profilers, and radiosondes, to provide more precise data on atmospheric conditions. 

Mission Mausam also envisions setting up a 'cloud-simulation chamber' to experiment with weather interventions like cloud seeding and lightning control. While weather modification remains uncertain, the mission emphasizes the importance of fundamental research in atmospheric sciences to mitigate the impacts of climate change.

### [​Essential, but not enough: on the extended coverage of the Ayushman Bharat Pradhan Mantri Jan Arogya Yojana](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bessential-but-not-enough-on-the-extended-coverage-of-the-ayushman-bharat-pradhan-mantri-jan-arogya-yojana/article68634754.ece)

The extension of Ayushman Bharat Prime Minister Jan Arogya Yojana (AB PM-JAY) to senior citizens over 70 is a positive step, but its limitations raise concerns. While the scheme offers ₹500,000 in annual coverage for hospitalization, it lacks outpatient care, diagnostics, and medication coverage. This is problematic as chronic diseases are prevalent in this age group, and a significant portion of healthcare expenditure occurs outside of hospitalization. 

Furthermore, the penetration of PM-JAY in smaller towns and cities is low, and the reliance on private hospitals further burdens the public healthcare system. Investing in robust primary and secondary care is crucial to reduce reliance on tertiary care and improve healthcare accessibility for the elderly.

Kolkata is facing a crisis as junior doctors and civil society protest the brutal rape and murder of a doctor. Their demands include swift justice, disciplinary action against hospital authorities, enhanced security, and an overhaul of the government health system.  

Despite a government initiative to protect healthcare workers, the situation remains tense. Doctors, who have defied court orders to return to work, are demanding televised talks with the government.  The ongoing protests have disrupted healthcare services, leaving many patients without essential medical attention, particularly those relying on government hospitals. With the upcoming festival season, pressure mounts on both the government and doctors to find a resolution and restore normalcy to the healthcare system.

The newly constituted Public Accounts Committee (PAC) under K.C. Venugopal is taking a proactive approach to its mandate, focusing on scrutinizing government expenditure and performance. The PAC has selected 161 subjects for deliberation, including five suo motu,  covering areas like banking, insurance, energy sector reforms, regulatory bodies, and public infrastructure fees.  This assertive stance comes amid a shift in parliamentary dynamics, with an opposition stronger than recent times and a coalition government relying on allies.  The PAC's actions have the potential to renew parliamentary oversight over the executive,  holding it accountable to the public, particularly in light of allegations of crony capitalism.

Venezuela's July 28 presidential election was highly contested, with the opposition claiming victory despite the official results declaring President Nicolás Maduro the winner. The opposition's candidate, Edmundo González, fled to Spain after facing charges of inciting protests.

The election process itself was marred by irregularities, and the Maduro government rejected calls to release full election results. Citing alleged foreign interference and threats, Maduro has increased his crackdown on dissent, resulting in numerous deaths and arrests. 

The international community has criticized the election and called for transparency, with even left-leaning governments condemning the violence and demanding a fair and democratic electoral process. Venezuela faces economic crisis, displacement, and growing international isolation.

Following recent pressure, the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council has agreed to form a Group of Ministers to review the 18% GST levy on insurance premiums. This marks a shift in stance from  previous council meetings and  the Finance Minister's previous defense of the tax. The council will reconvene in November to consider the group's recommendations. The push for change comes from various sources, including government ministers and coalition partners who argue that taxing insurance, particularly life and health insurance, is inappropriate. The government's own silence on recent buoyant GST collections may also signal a willingness to reconsider the levy.

Jannik Sinner and Aryna Sabalenka's US Open victories mark a new era in tennis.  Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz have split the four Grand Slams in 2024, ending the dominance of Federer, Nadal, and Djokovic.  This rise of new talent brings diversity to men's tennis with Sinner's methodical style contrasting Alcaraz's flair.  On the women's side, Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek have formed a dominant duo, securing seven of the last eleven Grand Slams. 2024 signifies a shift in the tennis landscape with fresh faces claiming top spots

The Union Health Ministry's approval of the BPaLM regimen for drug-resistant tuberculosis is a significant step towards India's goal of eliminating TB by 2025.  This new four-drug treatment, recommended by the WHO, offers better outcomes, reducing treatment duration to six months from the traditional 20 months and significantly improving quality of life for patients.  

The BPaLM regimen is particularly important for India, which has an estimated 75,000 people living with drug-resistant TB.  This move is expected to improve treatment outcomes and help thousands of patients achieve successful cures.

French President Emmanuel Macron called for snap parliamentary elections to counter the far-right National Rally (RN), but no party secured a majority. The leftist New Popular Front (NFP) emerged as the largest bloc but was blocked from forming a government. Macron instead appointed Michel Barnier, a conservative, as Prime Minister, relying on support from his own party and abstention from the RN. This decision sparked outrage as it seemingly undermines the election results and strengthens the far right's influence. Macron argues this ensures institutional stability, but critics view it as a betrayal of the people's mandate and a blow to French democracy.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's recent visits to Brunei and Singapore signify India's renewed focus on its "Act East" policy.  This marks a significant effort to strengthen ties with Southeast Asia, which have been neglected in recent years.  The visits aimed to re-establish connections, explore new collaborations, and address shared interests in areas like defence, geopolitics, trade, and technology. While discussions on trade, investment, and energy cooperation took place, concrete outcomes remain to be seen. The emphasis on semiconductors and space cooperation reflects India's desire for technological advancement and regional integration. 


For sustained engagement, India must address concerns raised by ASEAN, including its withdrawal from the RCEP and lack of progress on updating trade agreements. Closer coordination on geopolitical issues like Myanmar and the South China Sea is also crucial.

India's performance at the 2024 Paris Paralympics was its best ever, securing 29 medals and an 18th-place finish.  This success represents a  significant improvement from previous Paralympics, highlighting the dedication of Indian para-athletes and increased government support. 

Para-athletics dominated India's medal haul, with  achievements in javelin throw, high jump, and track events.  Notable performances included Avani Lekhara and Sumit Antil defending their gold medals, Mariyappan Thangavelu winning his third consecutive medal, and Sheetal Devi becoming the youngest Indian para-athlete to win a medal.  The inspiring success of these athletes and the enthusiastic support from spectators  reinforces the importance of continuing government and corporate support to foster the growth of para-sports in India.

The assembly elections in Jammu and Kashmir have generated significant anticipation, with parties focusing on restoration of Article 370 and statehood. Regional parties, including the NC, PDP and J&K Peoples’ Conference, have promised to reverse measures taken after 2019 and challenge the BJP's dominance. The BJP aims to expand its support base, appealing to marginalized communities and highlighting concerns about family control within other parties. The Congress is navigating a delicate stance, focusing on statehood restoration while avoiding direct mentions of Article 370. Notably, Jamaat-e-Islami and even separatists are participating in the elections, potentially paving the way for a new era of peace and stability.

The National Medical Commission (NMC) published a revised medical curriculum that drew significant criticism for its inclusion of outdated and discriminatory language.  The curriculum labelled sodomy, lesbianism, and transvestism as offenses, violating the Transgender Persons (Protection of Rights) Act, 2019.  It also removed mandatory disability competencies, contravening the Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016. 

These changes sparked protests from transgender and disability rights groups, who condemned the regression in inclusivity. The NMC eventually withdrew the guidelines, acknowledging the public outcry and legal concerns.

The year 2024 has seen significant setbacks for the Maoist movement in India, with 159 cadres killed in anti-Naxalite operations. Improved coordination between security forces has resulted in a string of successes, particularly in south Chhattisgarh.  This success is also attributed to the weakening base of support for the Maoists, as tribal populations are increasingly weary of the insurgency's violence. However, the government's "no-holds barred" approach, while effective against militants, has also raised concerns about the crackdown on peaceful activists fighting for tribal rights. Despite its resilience, the Maoist movement's outdated ideology has brought misery rather than progress to the very people it claims to represent. A shift towards engaging with the democratic system would be more beneficial for tribals caught in the crossfire.

The ILO's World Employment and Social Outlook study links declining labor income share to technological advancements like automation and AI. A 1.6% drop globally between 2004-24 translates to $2.4 trillion in lost wages. The pandemic exacerbated this trend, highlighting the challenge of creating jobs amid rising inequality. Notably, young women are disproportionately impacted, with nearly a third worldwide outside of employment, education or training. The study suggests a universal basic income could address this growing disparity.

The World Bank has raised India's GDP growth forecast for 2024-25 to 7%, aligning with predictions from the IMF and ADB. This upward revision comes despite a subdued global economic outlook. 

The Bank attributes India's strong growth to expected rises in private consumption and the farm sector. However, external risks like supply chain pressures and inflation remain a concern.  

The World Bank also emphasizes the need for India to revamp its trade strategy, suggesting a reduction in tariffs and non-tariff barriers to better capitalize on global opportunities.

Following the rape and murder of a doctor in Kolkata, the West Bengal Assembly passed a bill introducing the death penalty for certain sexual offenses. The bill amends the state's criminal laws to include death for rape, gang rape, and aggravated assaults. It also proposes special courts for time-bound trials of such cases.  While the call for tougher laws often arises after such incidents, the bill's efficacy in deterring sexual offences is questionable. Some argue that focusing on societal change and ensuring women's safety in homes and workplaces is more impactful than solely relying on legal sanctions.

The Supreme Court questioned the legality of demolishing houses belonging to accused individuals, highlighting a growing concern about the use of bulldozers as retribution.  The court acknowledged the political symbolism associated with these demolitions, particularly targeting Muslim homes in BJP-ruled states. While recognizing the legal grounds for removing encroachments, the court aims to establish nationwide guidelines ensuring due process and fairness in such actions.  The court must address the perception that these demolitions, often justified as anti-encroachment drives, serve a thinly veiled communal agenda, violating the rule of law and due process.

The recent regional elections in eastern Germany revealed a surge in support for the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD).  The AfD secured the largest share of votes in Thuringia and came second in Saxony. The party's success is attributed to its nationalist stance on immigration and attacks against the establishment. Meanwhile, the leftist nationalist-populist Reason and Justice Alliance (BSW) also gained significant support, highlighting growing anti-establishment sentiment. 

While the AfD is unlikely to form a government, its powerful position in the statehouse raises concerns about its influence. The establishment parties face a challenge in addressing the root causes of the AfD's rise, including economic woes and anxieties stemming from the war in Ukraine. Without addressing these underlying issues, political isolation of the far-right may prove insufficient.

The GST Council is set to meet on September 9 to discuss key issues within the indirect tax regime. A major focus will be the review of GST's complex rate structure. While progress on this front has been slow, the Council is expected to set a timeline for the ministerial group's deliberations and potentially explore alternative rate structures.  The meeting may also address concerns about the 18% GST levy on essential services like health insurance and life cover.  

Inclusion of items like electricity, petroleum, and alcohol under GST is another topic, although significant hurdles exist due to states' reservations.  The Council will also monitor the daily functioning of GST, particularly refund disbursement and revenue trends, to ensure smooth implementation and prevent issues for taxpayers.

Drone bombings in Manipur's Imphal West district claimed two lives and injured nine, attributed to Kuki-Zo militants in retaliation to an alleged Meitei ambush. This incident marks a dangerous escalation of the ethnic conflict, utilizing tactics reminiscent of Myanmar's pro-democracy insurgents.  While the government vows a six-month peace resolution, these attacks sow doubt and highlight the entrenched hostilities.  

 This incident exposes a critical intelligence failure, urging a stronger security response. However, a mere security approach proves insufficient. Disarming the various militant groups in the valley and hills is crucial to prevent further escalation. 


The Centre's and state government's reliance on buffer zones and security forces for over a year has demonstrably failed, failing to foster dialogue or address the hardening ethnic identities. This necessitates a shift in approach and leadership, with a firmer commitment to peace.

The ruling Mahayuti coalition in Maharashtra is facing internal discord, primarily between the BJP, Eknath Shinde's Shiv Sena, and Ajit Pawar's NCP. This tension emerged after a disappointing performance in the 2024 general election and is exacerbated by disagreements over policy initiatives and personal animosity.  A recent incident involving the collapse of a Shivaji Maharaj statue further strained relations, as it holds significant cultural importance for the Maratha community, to which Ajit Pawar and Sharad Pawar belong. Despite being political partners, the BJP and Shinde's Shiv Sena harbor resentment towards Ajit Pawar, while Ajit Pawar himself seems unsure of his alliance with them, expressing reservations about their tactics and suggesting possible connections with Sharad Pawar and the opposition Maha Vikas Aghadi. The coalition's divisions threaten its stability ahead of the upcoming assembly elections, while the opposition is benefiting from this disarray.

The recent US Open departures of Carlos Alcaraz and Novak Djokovic have sent shockwaves through the tennis world. Alcaraz, the World No.3, and Djokovic, the reigning champion and 24-time Grand Slam winner, both exited in the early rounds, marking a significant upset.  The defeats could be attributed to the physically and emotionally demanding summer both players endured,  including Alcaraz's French Open-Wimbledon double and Djokovic's Wimbledon final and Olympic gold medal. Notably, Djokovic's third-round loss signifies a potential shift in the sport's hierarchy, especially since it's his earliest exit from a Major since 2017. This opens up the possibility for new players like Jannik Sinner to dominate.

India's GDP growth for the first quarter of 2024-25 came in at 6.7%, lower than the Reserve Bank of India's projection and marking a slowdown in economic momentum.  While private consumption spending rose, external factors like the general election and erratic monsoon conditions have impacted growth.  Higher food prices, despite a better monsoon compared to last year, remain a concern.  The government is focused on boosting capital expenditure, but achieving  its targets remains a challenge.   The outlook for the year indicates  a growth rate of 6.5% to 7%,  with  potential to slip further in 2025-26. Some experts emphasize the need for  structural reforms and efficiency improvements in institutions to boost India's long-term growth prospects.

The article criticizes Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma for repeatedly using hate speech, particularly targeting the Bengali Muslim community. Sarma's inflammatory remarks, often made during election campaigns and in the wake of recent events, promote a divisive agenda and disregard his oath to uphold India's secular Constitution. The author argues that such rhetoric, reminiscent of hate speech that led to atrocities in Myanmar, is detrimental to societal harmony and development in Assam.  The article emphasizes the urgent need for the central government to address Sarma's behavior, contrasting the lack of action against him with the reprimand given to party leaders for targeting other groups.

The Supreme Court of India is addressing the issue of misleading advertisements for Ayurveda, Siddha, and Unani products.  This comes after a previous case against Patanjali Ayurved for making unproven claims. While some state agencies are taking action, the Court expresses concern over the Ministry of AYUSH's attempts to weaken quality control measures and advertising regulations for these products.  The Court emphasizes the need for a robust quality control regime, free from political interference, to protect consumers from potentially harmful products.

India's government has launched a new biotechnology initiative called BioE3, aiming to boost manufacturing in the sector. 

BioE3 seeks to establish companies through public-private partnerships, focusing on areas like bio-based chemicals, functional foods, precision biotherapeutics, climate-resilient agriculture, carbon capture, and futuristic marine and space research. The policy recognizes the need to move beyond research funding and create a robust manufacturing base for biotech products, addressing India's reliance on imports.  However, the success of BioE3 hinges on long-term government support, infrastructure development, and a collaborative approach between the Centre and States.

Recent diplomatic moves by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, including conversations with the US and Russian presidents, have raised speculation about India's potential role in mediating the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  While India has expressed support for peace, it has maintained a neutral stance, avoiding direct involvement in the conflict's resolution.  India's historical ties and economic dependencies on Russia present a challenge to its perceived impartiality.  

For a successful peace initiative, India would need to articulate clear principles and a focused agenda, similar to successful efforts like the Black Sea Grain Initiative.  Furthermore,  India would need to navigate conflicting proposals from Ukraine and Russia regarding military withdrawals and security guarantees.

A Supreme Court order granting bail to Bharat Rashtra Samithi leader K. Kavitha highlights a concerning trend of using arrests and legal proceedings to target political opponents. While the charges against Ms. Kavitha and other Delhi government officials regarding their liquor policy are serious and warrant investigation, the focus appears to be on prolonged detention rather than a fair trial. 

The court questioned the fairness of the investigation, noting the reliance on witnesses who are potentially involved in the alleged scheme and the granting of pardon to accused individuals in exchange for testimony. The court emphasized the need for a strong case based on concrete evidence and a timely trial, urging prosecutors to prioritize building a sound prosecution instead of contesting bail applications.

Following the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan, Pakistan, particularly Balochistan and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, has experienced a surge in terrorist attacks. On August 26th, the 18th death anniversary of Baloch nationalist leader Nawab Akbar Bugti, separatists carried out coordinated attacks across Balochistan, damaging infrastructure and targeting migrant laborers. 

This increased reach and capability of the insurgency highlight the longstanding issue of Baloch separatism in Pakistan.  Balochistan, despite its natural resources, remains underdeveloped, leading to resentment and exploitation accusations against the central government, particularly towards Punjab. 

While Pakistan's approach has been primarily military, it has failed to address the root causes of the conflict, such as poverty and human rights abuses. The recent attacks underscore the urgent need for the Pakistani government to engage with civil rights groups, address developmental concerns, and stop human rights violations to achieve stability and security in Balochistan.

The arrest of Telegram's founder Pavel Durov in France due to investigations into criminal activity on his platform, has sparked debate about free speech and responsibility. Durov, known for his stance on absolute free speech, argues that privacy trumps any fear of harm. However, Telegram's platform has been used for disseminating extremism, drug dealing, and child pornography.  

While Telegram's encryption makes it attractive for dissidents, it doesn't guarantee complete secrecy. The platform acknowledges moderation within industry standards and questions its liability for user abuse.  The incident highlights the complex balance between protecting free expression and preventing harm, prompting discussion about the responsibilities of platforms like Telegram towards moderating content.

There are concerns about the Union government's reported plans to collect caste data during the long-delayed Census. Given the shortcomings of the 2011 Socio-Economic and Caste Census, rushing into caste enumeration without a clear timeline for conducting the Census is unwise.  Conducting the Census promptly is crucial as it impacts various public schemes, policy decisions, and statistical surveys.

The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon has escalated following Israel's preemptive airstrikes on Lebanese targets and Hezbollah's subsequent rocket and drone attacks. Though both sides have indicated a willingness to de-escalate, the underlying tensions remain.  Israel's primary conflict with Hamas in Gaza continues, resulting in heavy casualties on both sides. While the U.S. supports a ceasefire and provides Israel with diplomatic and military aid, Hezbollah vows to continue its attacks in solidarity with Palestinians. Israel's strategy of targeting Hezbollah leadership has had limited success in curbing their attacks, highlighting the complexities and risks of escalating this conflict within a broader regional war.

### [Middle path: on the Unified Pension Scheme](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/middle-path-on-the-unified-pension-scheme/article68565757.ece)

The Indian government has reinstated a guaranteed pension scheme for its employees, partially addressing their demands and attempting to reconcile this with fiscal prudence. This move comes amidst a global pension crisis, driven by demographic shifts and other factors. The government argues that pension costs are a burden on future generations and contributes to its efforts to downsize and cut costs through measures like contract work and modified recruitment schemes. The restoration of the pension scheme, however, was a political necessity for the ruling BJP amidst pressure from the opposition Congress. The new Unified Pension Scheme offers a pension of 50% of the average salary in the employee's last year of service, with a minimum of ₹10,000 for those with at least 10 years of service.

The Justice K. Hema Committee report on the issues faced by women in Malayalam cinema has shed light on the pervasiveness of discrimination, exploitation, and sexual harassment.  The report points out the normalization of "casting couch" culture, where sexual favors are often demanded in exchange for roles, making the industry inherently exploitative. 

Other inequities highlighted include lack of basic facilities, pay disparity, and the absence of binding contracts.  The report calls for structural reforms, including the professionalization of the industry and the provision of adequate facilities for women.  The government is expected to take action on the report's recommendations, ensuring a safer and more equitable work environment for women in cinema.

Prime Minister Modi's visit to Kyiv signifies a balancing act in India's stance on the Russia-Ukraine war. India has maintained neutrality, abstaining from UN resolutions critical of Russia and continuing trade relations despite Western sanctions. While Modi's visit, the first by an Indian Prime Minister to Ukraine since its independence, signaled a desire to engage, it remained cautious. 

Discussions centered around peace, with agreements signed on cooperation in sectors like agriculture, culture, and medicine. However, there were no significant breakthroughs on strategic partnership, infrastructure supplies, or India's potential role in peace negotiations. Modi's visit, symbolic in nature,  reinforced India's position as a neutral mediator within the global South, prioritizing its own interests while encouraging direct dialogue between Russia and Ukraine.

This incident follows another deadly gas leak in 2020 and a fire accident at the same SEZ earlier this year.  Despite government efforts to streamline inspections and promote ease of doing business, the series of accidents raise questions about the effectiveness of these policies. 

Trade unions and activists are demanding stricter penalties for negligence, immediate safety audits of all units in SEZs, and a re-evaluation of exemptions from government inspections granted to certain industries. They argue that the current system may be compromising safety standards, and a thorough investigation is needed to address any potential loopholes and ensure worker safety in high-risk industries.

A  case of acute flaccid paralysis in Meghalaya is suspected to be polio. While the government has confirmed the case, details regarding the type of poliovirus (wild or vaccine-derived) and its specific strain (type 1, 2, or 3) remain unconfirmed. This delay is concerning as it impacts understanding the source of the virus and appropriate public health responses. 

India, having switched to a bivalent oral polio vaccine in 2016, has witnessed a decline in  wild poliovirus cases. However, the possibility of imported vaccine-derived polioviruses cannot be ruled out. 


The incident highlights the need for swift confirmation and analysis of polio cases, emphasizing the importance of fully transitioning to inactivated polio vaccine, as many developed countries have already done, for India's continued polio eradication efforts.

Following the murder of a doctor in Kolkata, the West Bengal government suggested minimizing night duty for women as a safety measure. This regressive approach is unlikely to address the root cause of violence against women and could further hinder their participation in the workforce, already low at 25.2% in urban India. 

The government should focus on implementing existing safety protocols like separate rest rooms, CCTV coverage, and a dedicated mobile app, rather than restricting women's working hours.  The Supreme Court has taken suo motu cognizance of the case and formed a national task force to ensure the safety of medical professionals.  The incident highlights the need for broader societal change and addressing the persistent issue of gender violence.

The Karnataka Governor's decision to approve a private complaint against Chief Minister Siddaramaiah for corruption has sparked a constitutional and political debate. The Governor's actions are being challenged by Mr. Siddaramaiah who argues that the Governor is bound by the Council of Ministers' advice to refuse sanction for prosecution. While the Governor believes a judicial inquiry is insufficient, the State government contends that its ordered inquiry is adequate. The case revolves around the allotment of land by the Mysore Urban Development Authority, with allegations suggesting potential impropriety.  The legality of granting private parties the authority to initiate prosecutions after the 2018 amendment to the Prevention of Corruption Act is also a key point of contention.

While some key sectors like electronics and textiles showed growth, petroleum, gems and jewelry, and chemicals experienced significant decline.  A surge in imports, particularly petroleum and consumer goods, widened the trade deficit to a nine-month high of $23.5 billion. The Commerce Ministry remains optimistic about surpassing last year's export record, but external factors like geopolitical tensions, rising freight costs, and slowing global demand pose challenges.  domestic export-boosting schemes require clarity and extension to ensure competitiveness amidst global competition.

India's retail inflation dipped to 3.54% in July, the lowest in nearly five years, primarily driven by a decline in vegetable prices.  This eased pressure on the Reserve Bank of India, which maintained its interest rate stance for the ninth consecutive time.  Though the inflation rate aligned with the RBI's target, the MPC raised its inflation projection for the quarter, anticipating a rebound in price rise through August and September. 

Despite the July dip, persistent price pressures remain, particularly in food items like pulses. Core inflation also showed a first increase since January 2023, fuelled by rising service costs including telecom tariff hikes.  The RBI anticipates a meaningful easing of food inflation only by October when the next harvest arrives.

The article discusses the recent political upheaval in Bangladesh, leading to the dramatic escape of ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.  Hasina, once lauded for her economic reforms and fight against terrorism, faced mounting criticism for her authoritarian tactics, including suppressing dissent and alleged vote rigging.  Protests by students, sparked by quotas issues, became the final catalyst for her downfall.  

Hasina's actions, seen as eroding Bangladesh's democracy, drew ire from both domestic and international actors.  The article highlights India's role in complicity, both by failing to advise Hasina against her policies and by neglecting to engage with Bangladeshi opposition. It urges the Indian government to actively engage with the new regime and work towards  a peaceful transition and more inclusive democratic processes in Bangladesh.

### [​Healing a nation: On Kamala Harris and the U.S. Presidential race](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bhealing-a-nation-on-kamala-harris-and-the-us-campaign-race/article68492788.ece)

Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic Party's nominee for president following President Joe Biden's withdrawal from the race.  Harris has selected Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.  She has seen a boost in poll numbers since entering the race and has raised significant funds.  

The Trump campaign, which had previously focused its attacks on Biden, is now shifting tactics to target Harris, using personal attacks and race-based rhetoric. This potentially allows Harris to appeal to a broader base and focus on a more inclusive agenda.  The outcome of the election will have significant implications for the United States and the world, particularly in light of ongoing global conflicts.

### [On the edge: On West Asia and the danger of a wider war](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-the-edge-the-hindu-editorial-on-west-asia-and-the-danger-of-a-wider-war/article68489181.ece)

Recent assassinations in Beirut and Tehran of senior Hezbollah and Hamas leaders have heightened tensions in the Middle East, bringing it closer to a wider conflict. Israel claimed responsibility for the strike on Beirut but hasn't confirmed its role in the killing in Tehran.  

Hezbollah has retaliated with rocket fire, and Iran is expected to respond strongly to the death of Haniyeh, a political leader in Tehran for a presidential inauguration. While Israel aims to send a strong message to Hamas with this operation, it risks provoking a wider war with Iran and potentially drawing the US into the conflict. The killings have also jeopardized ceasefire talks, as Haniyeh was seen as a moderate voice pushing for peace.

### [On target: On the Olympics and Indian shooters](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/on-target-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-olympics-and-indian-shoote/article68489209.ece)

Indian shooters finally ended the Olympic medal drought in Paris 2024. Manu Bhaker made history by becoming the first Indian woman to win an Olympic shooting medal, securing bronze in the 10m air pistol and the mixed 10m air pistol event.  Her success is a testament to the advancements in Indian shooting and a tribute to the established system that supports the sport. Bhaker's journey follows in the footsteps of  Anjali Bhagwat and Suma Shirur, who inspired a generation of shooters despite facing limitations in resources and recognition. 


Swapnil Kusale also won a bronze in the men's 50m rifle three positions, while Arjun Babuta's fourth-place finish in the men's 10m air rifle final highlighted the sport's demanding nature and narrow margins. In contrast, India's archery team continued to struggle in Paris.

### [​Election overhang: On economic activity](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Belection-overhang-the-hindu-editorial-on-economic-activity/article68485015.ece)

India's core infrastructure sector growth slowed to a 20-month low of 4% in June, largely due to reduced state spending on public works after the general election and ongoing heatwaves.  Output in key sectors like refinery products and electricity declined, while steel production saw a dip due to sluggish construction activity. Coal production, however, saw an acceleration.  Meanwhile, a private survey revealed a marginal slowdown in manufacturing activity in July, but a concerning rise in input costs forced manufacturers to increase selling prices at their steepest rate in almost 11 years, raising concerns about broader inflation.

### [​Medieval-minded: On anti-conversion law in Uttar Pradesh, its amendments](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bmedieval-minded-the-hindu-editorial-on-anti-conversion-law-in-uttar-pradesh-its-amendments/article68485116.ece)

The Uttar Pradesh Assembly has amended its anti-conversion law, making it more stringent. The amendments increase jail terms, particularly for conversions involving minors, women, or specific communities. 

They also impose harsh penalties for receiving foreign funds for conversion purposes and introduce stricter bail conditions.  A significant change allows anyone to file a complaint against alleged forcible or fraudulent conversions, raising concerns about its potential misuse against inter-faith marriages. 

Government claims of a rise in forced conversions lack evidence, and the law's validity remains questionable as it criminalizes inter-faith marriages and treats "conversion by marriage" as unlawful.

### [​Weakest first: On judiciary and sub-categorisation within a class](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bweakest-first-on-judiciary-and-sub-categorisation-within-a-class/article68477898.ece)

The Supreme Court has ruled that states can sub-classify Scheduled Castes (SCs) to provide preferential treatment to the most backward among them. This decision overturns a 2005 ruling which held that SCs constitute a single homogenous class and barred states from sub-classification.  The Court recognized that while SCs share a common constitutional status, their levels of backwardness vary.  The verdict allows states to identify weaker sections within SCs and extend benefits accordingly. Four judges also suggested excluding the "creamy layer" among SCs from reservation benefits, a concept currently applied to Other Backward Classes (OBCs). While this exclusion requires further consideration, the primary focus should remain on ensuring adequate representation for the marginalized within the Dalit community.

### [Stealing the vote: On the Venezuelan presidential election](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/stealing-the-vote-on-the-venezuelan-presidential-election/article68477758.ece)

Venezuela's presidential election, where incumbent Nicolás Maduro secured a sixth-year term, has sparked controversy. Despite pre-election polls suggesting a significant lead for opposition candidate Edmundo González, official results declared Maduro the winner with 51% of the vote. The opposition has vehemently denounced the election as fraudulent, citing widespread irregularities and a discrepancy between their internal tallies and the official results released by the electoral authority. 

Protests erupted following the announcement, and international pressure mounted on Maduro's regime. The U.S. recognized González as the victor, and even some of Maduro's leftist allies in Latin America called for transparency in the vote count. While Maduro retains the support of the military, the deeply divided nation and international condemnation cast doubt on the legitimacy of his presidency.

The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting is working on the Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2023, but its consultations have been limited and secretive. While an earlier draft was shared publicly, the latest versions are only given to a select few under strict confidentiality agreements.  This lack of transparency raises concerns as the Bill could further restrict free expression in media, building on existing regulations that have already chilled creative output. Excluding a wider range of stakeholders, including online creators and civil society, from meaningful input undermines the quality and legitimacy of the proposed legislation.

### [Contested harvest: On India and genetically modified food crop](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/contested-harvest-on-india-and-genetically-modified-food-crop/article68473513.ece)

The Supreme Court of India delivered a split verdict on the approval of genetically modified (GM) mustard. The only currently permissible GM seed in India is cotton. DMH-11, a GM mustard variety developed by Delhi University, passed trials showing consistent yield improvements compared to existing varieties. 

The GEAC, India's scientific advisory body, approved DMH-11 but environmentalist groups contested the decision, raising concerns about its herbicide tolerance and potential environmental impact. Justice Nagarathna ruled that the GEAC violated the precautionary principle, while Justice Karol supported the GEAC's process.  The case now proceeds to a larger bench.  Significantly, the court ordered the government to develop a policy on GM crops, acknowledging the complex ideological and environmental considerations surrounding this technology.

### [Unnatural disaster: On the Wayanad landslides](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/unnatural-disaster-on-the-wayanad-landslides/article68468839.ece)

Heavy rains and resultant landslides in Kerala's Wayanad district highlight the deadly combination of climate change and inadequate preparedness. While landslides are a regular occurrence during the southwest monsoon, the scale of this tragedy, with 200 fatalities, is unprecedented. The Chaliyar river, swollen by heavy rains, carried debris downstream, devastating villages settled on less steep land.  

Past environmental damage, including the 2020 floods that stripped upstream plant cover, exacerbated the situation. The state's vulnerability to landslides is well documented, with risk maps highlighting the areas.  

This disaster underscores the need for robust warning systems, emergency preparedness, and responsible land use practices.  Authorities must prioritize restoring denuded flora and exploring alternative economic opportunities for residents of vulnerable regions,  while heedfully considering the impact of development on fragile ecosystems.

The Indian government is exploring a partnership with the private sector to study and test small modular reactors (SMRs) as part of its nuclear energy strategy. SMRs are smaller, potentially safer, and more cost-effective than traditional nuclear reactors. However, their viability depends on several factors, including addressing concerns about proliferation risks, ensuring commercial affordability, and establishing stable grid infrastructure. The government's privatization of nuclear power generation also raises the need for robust regulatory safeguards to prevent the diversion of radioactive materials for military purposes.

### [Option or stratagem?: On Governors, powers and Bills](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/option-or-stratagem-on-governors-powers-and-bills/article68464847.ece)

The article discusses the actions of some Governors in India regarding legislation passed by State assemblies. Governors have been sending Bills they disapprove of to the President for consideration, bypassing the State legislatures and potentially allowing the Center undue influence over State laws. 

This practice raises concerns about the misuse of the provision for reserving Bills for the President's assent and its implications for federalism.  The Supreme Court's previous rulings in cases involving Punjab, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana underscored the limited discretion of Governors and their obligation to  act on Bills promptly. 

Kerala has challenged this practice in court, arguing that Governors' actions impede the legislative process and undermine the Constitution.

### [​Impatience with jobs: On the Budget speech](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bimpatience-with-jobs-on-the-budget-speech/article68464869.ece)

The Union Budget prioritized employment, proposing a ₹2 lakh crore package to facilitate jobs and skills. The package includes three employment-linked incentive schemes, aiming to encourage hiring of fresh graduates and incentivize companies to increase their workforce. 

To bridge the skills gap, 1,000 industrial training institutes will be upgraded and an ambitious internship program for one crore youth will be launched. This focus on tackling unemployment acknowledges a key issue highlighted by the opposition and driven by concerns over India's high youth unemployment rate, viewed as a threat to long-term growth.  


While the package shows good intent, its success in boosting employment remains to be seen. 


Analysts suggest that for a significant improvement in the employment outlook, the government must also expedite filling public sector vacancies and foster conditions to enhance consumption, which will incentivize private sector expansion and hiring.

The fatal flooding at a Delhi IAS coaching centre underscores the increasing risk of urban flooding and the role of human error. Basements, often used for non-permitted residential or commercial purposes, are particularly vulnerable due to limited access and ventilation.  

While building regulations generally prohibit habitation in basements,  economic pressures often lead to their use for income-generating activities like coaching centres. 

The Delhi Master Plan mandates clearances for basement use but enforcement is weak.  Problems with civic infrastructure, like the burst stormwater drain in this case, exacerbate the issue. 
Building codes require flood resilience measures, such as flood-barrier gates and non-return valves, to prevent water from entering basements. This tragic incident highlights the need for stricter enforcement and better preparation to mitigate urban flooding risks.

A rocket attack on a football ground in the Golan Heights, resulting in the death of 12 young people, has heightened tensions in West Asia. Israel and the U.S. have blamed Hezbollah for the attack, although the group initially claimed to have targeted Israeli military outposts and later denied involvement. Tensions have been simmering since the Hamas attack on Israel in October 2023, with Hezbollah launching rocket attacks from southern Lebanon in retaliation for Israel's military operations in Gaza. The Majdal Shams attack has broken the unwritten rules of a limited conflict, raising fears of a wider war.  Hezbollah, strengthened since its last war with Israel in 2006, possesses a large arsenal and has vowed to continue its support for Palestinians. The situation is precarious, with the potential for Iran's involvement and a devastating escalation. A peaceful resolution requires both sides to de-escalate tensions and end the war in Gaza.

The NITI Aayog's role has been questioned following the boycott of its ninth Governing Council meeting by seven Chief Ministers. These Chief Ministers, representing opposition-led states, expressed dissatisfaction with the Union Budget's allocation of funds and projects to their states.  This action, along with the later walkout by the West Bengal Chief Minister, highlights the  growing disenchantment among states with the think tank's limited advisory role and lack of power in resource distribution.  Despite its aim of "cooperative federalism", the NITI Aayog's focus on indices and lack of institutional backing for state development has  led to concerns about "competitive federalism".

### [Plastic mess: On India’s waste problem](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/plastic-mess-on-indias-waste-problem/article68457840.ece)

India generates approximately four million tonnes of plastic waste annually, of which only a quarter is properly recycled.  The Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme mandates plastic users to collect and recycle their waste, using a certificate-based trading platform.  However, fraudulent certificates and hacking have raised concerns about the system's effectiveness.  The Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) is auditing registered recyclers and enhancing the platform's security. While these steps are necessary, they highlight the limitations of a market-driven approach.  Ultimately, reducing plastic production and promoting sustainable alternatives are crucial for addressing India's plastic waste problem.

The Israeli Defence Forces issued another evacuation order in Gaza even as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu addressed a joint session of the U.S. Congress. The war, triggered by a Hamas attack in October, has resulted in over 39,000 Palestinian deaths, widespread displacement, and severe humanitarian conditions. International pleas for a ceasefire and condemnations of Israel's actions have been largely ignored. While the Biden administration has expressed concern over civilian casualties, U.S. support for Israel, including military aid, continues. Protests in Washington and dissenting voices highlight growing public criticism of the war and American involvement.

### [Fiscal federalism: On taxing mineral rights](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/editorial-on-sc-judgment-on-taxing-mining-activities-fiscal-federalism/article68450896.ece)

The Supreme Court ruled that states have the power to tax mineral rights and mineral-bearing lands.  This decision reverses the long-held belief that the 1957 Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act prevented states from doing so. The court determined that the Act's royalty provisions are not taxes, but rather contractual considerations. 

The ruling is seen as a victory for fiscal federalism, as it grants states a new source of revenue. However, one dissenting judge expressed concern that this decision could lead to unhealthy competition among states, potentially inflating mineral costs and harming the national market.

The Union Budget for 2024-25 includes special provisions for Andhra Pradesh and Bihar, both states led by parties that provide support to the BJP.  The budget allocates significant funds for infrastructure projects in both states, including road construction, power plants, and irrigation projects.  While these allocations address the debt burdens and developmental needs of these states, the budget has also been criticized for its uneven distribution of funds.   Critics point out that other financially advanced states, which contribute significantly to the national revenue, have received less attention, potentially hindering their growth and economic competitiveness.  The budget thus raises questions about the balance between addressing regional disparities and fostering overall national development.

The Paris Olympics, beginning this Friday, mark a return to normalcy after the pandemic-affected Tokyo Games. While Russia remains banned due to its war, Israel will participate despite controversies. The Games promise competitive excellence from nations like the U.S., China, and smaller nations vying for glory. Individual athletes, like Rafael Nadal and Carlos Alcaraz, will seek Olympic glory, adding to the appeal. The inclusion of breakdancing highlights the evolving intersection of sports and entertainment. Beyond competition, the Olympics offer hope and a platform for smaller nations like Morocco, who have already made a mark.  Security remains a priority after the tragic events of 1972 Munich.

The Supreme Court of India has ruled on a disputed physics question in the NEET 2024 exam, reducing the number of toppers from 61 to 17. The court based its decision on expert opinion from IIT Delhi, stating there could only be one correct answer.  As a result,  4 lakh students, including 44 toppers, will lose 5 marks each. The court's intervention comes amidst a series of irregularities in the NEET exam, including allegations of paper leaks and inconsistencies in answer keys. While the revised scores will delay the counselling process, the court's decision aims to restore faith in the exam. This episode highlights the need for systemic reforms to ensure the integrity and fairness of entrance examinations.

The Supreme Court of India has halted the enforcement of directives by Uttar Pradesh and Uttarakhand governments that required food stalls along the Kanwar Yatra route to display the names and identity details of their owners and employees. Petitioners argued that these directives would be discriminatory and undermine the secular nature of India. The Court acknowledged the need for immediate intervention and issued notices to Uttar Pradesh, Uttarakhand, Delhi, and Madhya Pradesh, the states along the pilgrimage route.  


The Kanwar Yatra is a major pilgrimage where Shiva devotees walk hundreds of kilometers carrying water pots to temples. The controversial directives sparked criticism  from opposition parties and even BJP allies, who denounced the communal implications. Reports surfaced of harassment of meat shop owners and pressure on Hindu hotel owners to remove their Muslim staff.

Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman's Budget focuses heavily on addressing unemployment, particularly among youth.  Aimed at 4.1 crore youth over five years, a central outlay of ₹2 lakh crore supports various schemes.  One flagship initiative offers a one-month salary subsidy to new formal sector employees, provided employment lasts at least 12 months. Other schemes promote job creation in manufacturing, incentivize employers who hire more, and provide skilling opportunities through ITIs. In a nod to the opposition's criticisms, the government has also pledged to support MSMEs through credit guarantees and easier access to government contracts.  While the middle class benefits from tax relief, spending on social sectors like school and higher education has been reduced, as has the allocation for the rural job guarantee scheme, MGNREGA.

President Joe Biden has unexpectedly withdrawn from the 2024 U.S. presidential race, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement.  His decision comes amidst pressure from within the Democratic Party due to concerns about his age and recent public appearances.  Harris is now the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination, becoming the first Indian-American and woman-of-colour to potentially secure a major party's presidential nomination. While she faces challenges, including relatively low national name recognition and Republican attacks on her political positions, she is well-positioned to benefit from Biden's endorsement and campaign funds. The Democratic Party is expected to unite around Harris and her running mate, with potential choices including Gavin Newsom, Gretchen Whitmer, and Pete Buttigieg. However, the Republican Party, led by Donald Trump, remains a strong contender, particularly in swing states crucial for victory.

Violent student protests erupted in Bangladesh over the reinstated quota system, which reserves a large percentage of government jobs for specific categories.  Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's handling of the protests, which included labeling the students as collaborators with the Pakistani forces during the 1971 Liberation War, escalated the crisis. The protests, backed by the opposition, brought the capital city to a standstill.  After a significant number of deaths and widespread unrest, the Supreme Court scaled back the quota system, offering a partial victory to the protesters. The crisis exposes the fragile relationship between civil society and the state, fueled by the country's economic challenges and political tensions.

A recent global software glitch caused widespread disruptions to essential services, highlighting the world's reliance on interconnected information technologies. 

While technological advancement is crucial,  ensuring robust failsafes and emergency protocols is equally important.  This is especially vital in societies where new technologies are unevenly adopted, potentially causing disproportionate impacts on different sectors. 

The incident underscores the need for a comprehensive approach to digital infrastructure, including open-source solutions, integrity testing, and redundancy measures to safeguard against network failures and protect against vulnerabilities.  Governments play a crucial role in establishing resilient digital systems that are transparent, equitable, and capable of withstanding disruptions.

Leading the charge in other disciplines are Nikhat Zareen, Amit Panghal, Antim Panghal, Vinesh Phogat, Satwiksairaj Rankireddy and Chirag Shetty. The Indian shooting team seeks to rebound after disappointing performances in recent Olympics. In hockey, after claiming a bronze in Tokyo, the team looks to continue its strong momentum.  An improved medal count in Paris will solidify India's position as a rising sporting nation.

The Karnataka government's draft bill, aiming to reserve 50% of management and 70% of non-management positions for local candidates, sparked controversy. Similar bills in Andhra Pradesh, Haryana, and Jharkhand faced legal challenges and were found to be unconstitutional.  

Such laws violate the equality and freedom of citizens enshrined in the Constitution and contradict the rights of migrant workers. Highlighting the court's judgement striking down the Haryana Act, the article argues that protectionism based on local residency is not a solution for labor market concerns. Instead, the focus should be on enforcing labor rights for all workers and curbing exploitative practices to create a level playing field.

The event, notable for being the first in-person gathering since the COVID-19 pandemic, featured prominent female figures, possibly aiming to soften Trump's image. The selection of J.D.

The Maharashtra government's proposed Bill to combat left-wing extremism has drawn criticism for its potential unconstitutionality and vague language. Critics argue that existing laws are sufficient to address the limited scope of left-wing extremism in the state.  The Bill's broad definitions of "unlawful activity" and "urban Naxal," potentially encompassing peaceful dissent and protests, raise concerns about its potential for misuse against activists and individuals critical of the government. The Bill allows for severe penalties, including lengthy prison sentences and seizure of property, raising concerns about civil liberties. Though expected to lapse with the current Assembly, the questionable intent behind the Bill remains a concern.

India's merchandise exports continued their upward trend for the third consecutive month in June, reaching $35.2 billion. Imports, however, grew at a faster pace, reaching $56.2 billion, resulting in a trade deficit of $21 billion, though slightly lower than the previous month. The oil deficit, although narrowed to $10 billion, remains a concern due to rising oil imports.  Gold imports saw a significant decline, while silver imports surged. Concerns exist about potential disruptions in the bullion market due to concessional duty imports through the GIFT City under the UAE trade pact. The government is urged to focus on boosting exports and address the decline in gems and jewellery exports.

Recent Supreme Court observations regarding arrests under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) highlight the balance between government power and personal liberty. One observation questioned whether arresting officers must demonstrate the necessity for an arrest under PMLA, which mandates "reason to believe" the person is guilty of money-laundering.  

The Court emphasized that arrest decisions should be legally sound and justifiable, not arbitrary. It also expressed concern about the frequent stays granted on bail orders, urging higher courts to be cautious in such instances and only intervene when warranted by compelling reasons.

### [In search of jobs: On the challenge of employment generation](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/in-search-of-jobs-on-challenge-of-employment-generation/article68414664.ece)

The Indian government faces a significant challenge in creating jobs, especially with a growing young population and an economy increasingly driven by technology.  Recent studies highlight the issue, showing stagnant manufacturing employment and a slow shift away from agriculture.  

The ASUSE survey reveals that the majority of employees are in the 'Other Services' and 'Trading' sectors, while the ILO warns of insufficient job creation to meet future demand. While the government can't solve the problem instantly, it can explore solutions like a robot tax, incentivizing job creation, and investing in agriculture to support farmers and create employment opportunities. Collaboration between the government, private sector, labor unions, and states is crucial to creating a growth model that prioritizes job creation.

### [​Surprise acceleration: On price gains](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bsurprise-acceleration-on-price-gains/article68410800.ece)

India's retail inflation surged unexpectedly in June, reaching 5.08% compared to 4.80% in May. This acceleration was primarily driven by a sharp rise in food prices, which increased by 9.36% year-on-year.  The rise in food prices was broad-based, with eight out of nine sub-categories seeing month-on-month increases. Vegetables, particularly potatoes, onions, and tomatoes, experienced the most significant price hikes. The outlook for food prices remains uncertain,  due to factors such as deficient rainfall in key food-growing regions.  The Reserve Bank of India's ongoing vigilance on food inflation is warranted, as these price shocks can have a broader impact on the economy.

Spain clinched its fourth European Championship title with impressive performances, showcasing a blend of experience and youth under coach Luis de la Fuente. Argentina, led by Lionel Scaloni and captain Lionel Messi, secured its 16th Copa America trophy after a thrilling tournament that featured standout displays from young players and resilient performances from underdog teams. However, the Copa America in the United States was marred by organizational issues, raising concerns ahead of the 2026 World Cup co-hosted by the US, Canada and Mexico.

Former President Donald Trump survived an assassination attempt at a Pennsylvania rally.  A gunman, identified as Thomas Crooks, fired at Trump, who was quickly escorted from the stage. Crooks died after being shot by law enforcement. The incident, occurring amidst heightened political tensions and rhetoric, garnered condemnation from across the political spectrum, including President Joe Biden. 

While the attack may potentially bolster Trump's standing in the upcoming election, concern remains about the potential for heightened political animosity and the use of divisive language. The incident serves as a stark reminder of the fragility of American democracy and the importance of civil discourse.

Carlos Alcaraz's victory over Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon marks a significant shift in the tennis landscape. Alcaraz, at 21, has now defeated Djokovic twice in a row, cementing his status as a dominant force.  This win, coupled with his earlier 2023 triumph, signifies the end of the Big Three's era and the beginning of a new generation. Alcaraz's all-around skills and mental strength have propelled him to four Grand Slam titles in just two years, surpassing even the accomplishments of Andy Murray and Stan Wawrinka. While other talented players like Jannik Sinner and Daniil Medvedev are emerging, Alcaraz stands out as the most complete player currently.  The women's game, meanwhile, sees a greater sense of fluidity with Barbora Krejcikova adding the Wimbledon title to her French Open victory. However, the dominance of Iga Swiatek and Aryna Sabalenka on other surfaces suggests that they are poised to become major contenders on grass as well.

The INDIA bloc secured 10 out of 13 Assembly seats in by-elections held across seven states.  The results reflect a potential decline in the BJP's popularity. In Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand, Congress victories restored the ruling parties' numbers after defections, demonstrating a rejection of opportunistic moves.  However, the Congress suffered losses in Madhya Pradesh, highlighting the need for leadership changes.  The DMK solidified its position in Tamil Nadu, while the TMC continued its dominance in West Bengal and the AAP achieved a win in Punjab, defeating an ex-Congress MLA who defected to the BJP.

Nepal's Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal narrowly escaped a confidence vote in June 2023, only to lose it a few months later in July 2024. Dahal, leader of the Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre), formed a coalition government after the 2022 elections but lost support from the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) led by Khadka Prasad Oli. This led to a new coalition between Oli's party and the Nepali Congress, with Oli becoming Prime Minister. 

Nepal's democratic journey since 1990 has been marked by instability and frequent changes in government, posing challenges to good governance. 
Despite constitutional reforms, Nepal continues to struggle. The obsession of major political parties with power over ideology and principle has led to an unstable and unprincipled form of coalition politics, fueling public disillusionment. The current scenario suggests that a shift towards a presidential system might benefit Nepal.

Prime Minister Modi's visit to Moscow, his first "stand-alone" trip during his tenure, focused on strengthening bilateral ties with Russia. Despite the visit's bilateral framework, it drew international criticism, particularly from Kyiv and Washington, due to its timing. The leaders emphasized economic and trade cooperation, setting a goal of $100 billion in bilateral trade by 2030.  Modi also secured assurances for the return of Indian recruits from the Russian Army. Notably absent were announcements of military purchases, likely influenced by Russia's supply delays and international pressure. While Modi reiterated his stance on no solution through battlefield conflict, his visit, coinciding with a major Ukrainian missile attack and a NATO summit, generated controversy. India faces the challenge of managing its relationship with the West amidst these complex geopolitical dynamics.

This incident emphasizes the importance of comprehensive road safety measures, encompassing road design, speed control, vehicle upkeep, and responsible driving practices.  Data from the National Crime Records Bureau and an IIT Delhi report underscore the severity of road accidents as a public health crisis.  The article proposes solutions, including stricter penalties for violators, improved data collection on vehicle safety, and increased public awareness about vehicle safety standards.

The Supreme Court ruled that divorced Muslim women can seek maintenance under the Code of Criminal Procedure (CrPC), clarifying a point of contention regarding the 1986 Muslim Women (Protection of Rights on Divorce) Act. While the 1986 Act codified certain rights for divorced Muslim women, including maintenance during the Iddat period, the Court stated that it does not negate their right to seek maintenance under the CrPC, which is available to women of all religions. This decision reaffirms the secular principles of equality and prevents a discriminatory interpretation of the 1986 Act. Both Justice Masih and Justice Nagarathna, in their respective opinions, emphasized that both personal law provisions and secular remedies for maintenance should coexist and cater to the diverse needs of women.

The results of the NEET-UG 2024 examination have triggered widespread controversy due to allegations of paper leaks, malpractice, technical failures, and the grant of grace marks. While a report by IIT Madras found no evidence of mass malpractice, student outrage persists. The Supreme Court has rescheduled a hearing on complaints regarding the exam irregularities.  

This controversy has eroded public trust in the NEET, which was intended to ensure fair and merit-based selection for medical and dental seats. To restore confidence, the government must engage transparently with affected students, address concerns publicly, acknowledge any errors, and implement measures to enhance the examination process's integrity.

Tensions have escalated between the West Bengal Governor C.V. Ananda Bose and the state government. Governor Bose has requested a report from the state government regarding the actions taken against Kolkata Police Commissioner Vineet Goyal and Deputy Commissioner of Police Indira Mukherjee. 

The Governor believes the officers acted improperly by commenting on an investigation into a sexual harassment complaint filed by a Raj Bhavan employee against him, despite the Governor's immunity. He also claims Commissioner Goyal prevented a group with grievances about post-election violence from meeting with him. The Governor has further demanded a report on incidents of mob violence in the state. This conflict  highlights the growing friction between Governors and state governments, fueled by political differences and the potential politicization of Raj Bhavan.

Karnataka's new Gig Workers Bill aims to improve the lives of India's growing gig workforce by offering social security, preventing arbitrary dismissals, and providing grievance redress. This legislation, a step forward from the current social security code, establishes a welfare board funded by the government and platforms. While welcomed, the bill falls short of granting gig workers full employee status, a point of contention for worker unions who advocate for greater protections and a transaction-based fee on platforms. The success hinges on swift implementation and the effectiveness of the established welfare board, given the lackluster performance of similar initiatives in the past.

Five Indian Army personnel were killed in an ambush by terrorists in Jammu on July 8th. This incident occurred on the anniversary of Burhan Wani's death and is the latest in a series of attacks, particularly in the Rajouri-Poonch area, marking a shift in terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir. 

The attack follows a June incident where terrorists targeted a bus carrying pilgrims, killing nine and injuring 33. This region, once subdued, is seeing a resurgence of violence, potentially due to troop redeployment to the Line of Actual Control, local intelligence gaps, and the use by terrorists of modern technology.  The rise of new terror groups and the push to use local militants are further complicating the situation. A multi-layered strategy involving all stakeholders is needed to address this evolving challenge.

Russia launched missile strikes on June 8, 2024, hitting civilian targets in Ukraine, including a children's hospital, resulting in casualties. Russia claimed the strikes targeted military installations, but this assertion is questionable given its history of bombing civilian areas. The attack occurred ahead of a NATO summit where member countries are expected to discuss long-term military aid for Ukraine. Meanwhile, Ukraine has been conducting drone attacks on Russia's military and energy infrastructure. With neither side achieving a decisive victory, there is a growing need for diplomatic solutions to end the conflict.  Calls for dialogue have come from global leaders including China's President Xi Jinping and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

A recent meeting between the Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana marks a positive shift in the relationship between the two states after a decade of tension. The leaders agreed on a three-tier mechanism to resolve outstanding issues arising from Telangana's formation in 2014. 

This collaborative approach involves committees of officials and ministers, escalating to the Chief Ministers themselves for the most difficult issues.

France's New Popular Front, a coalition of left parties,  gained the most seats in the recent snap election, surpassing President Macron's centrist alliance.  Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally also performed well, securing a significant number of seats.  No party achieved an absolute majority,  leading to potential political uncertainty.

Prime Minister Modi's visit to Moscow marks a significant reaffirmation of the India-Russia partnership.  This is the first bilateral visit for Modi in his third term and comes amidst the ongoing war in Ukraine, making it a significant event.  Discussions will cover key bilateral issues such as trade, energy, space cooperation, and defense supplies, but a key focus will be the war in Ukraine. India is concerned about the conflict's global impact, particularly on defense deliveries and sanctions, and seeks a diplomatic solution. 

The visit also sends a geopolitical message, contrasting with the NATO summit in Washington.  India, while maintaining its stance of "dialogue and diplomacy," seeks to leverage its unique position to promote peace and an end to the conflict.

The recent Iranian presidential election saw a surprising victory for Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist candidate who advocates for change. Pezeshkian's win over conservative rival Saeed Jalili signifies a shift in the political landscape, as the reformist coalition regained momentum after electoral setbacks.  Pezeshkian's platform calls for  greater social freedoms, opposition to moral policing, and engagement with the West to revive the 2015 nuclear deal. Despite the limitations on the President's power in Iran's theocratic system, Pezeshkian's strong mandate from a resurgent electorate offers an opportunity for gradual reforms and a more open dialogue with the international community.   This victory could potentially signal a path for Iran to navigate its current economic and social challenges.

He emphasized the need to prioritize peace and stability, but also blamed the Congress for past handling of similar incidents, attributing the state's tensions to deep-rooted social divisions. However, the situation in Manipur remains far from normal, with significant displacement, continued violence, and a breakdown of services. 
Despite central agency intervention, a peace breakthrough seems unlikely without a change in leadership, which neither Modi nor Home Minister Amit Shah appears willing to initiate.

Keir Starmer led the Labour Party to a historic victory in the UK general election, securing a majority mandate. 

This win is largely attributed to the Conservative Party's 14-year tenure marked by issues like Brexit mismanagement, economic crises, underfunding of public services, and various scandals. 

While Starmer aims to rebuild the country with policies focused on economic growth for the working class and environmental goals, he faces pressures regarding immigration and the performance of far-right parties.

The US Supreme Court ruled that the President enjoys either absolute or presumptive immunity from criminal prosecution.  This decision, based on the separation of powers doctrine, was made by a 6-3 majority and does not directly address former President Trump's potential prosecution for election interference. The ruling establishes a test for future prosecutions, considering whether the alleged act involved core constitutional duties, official acts, or unofficial acts.  While absolute immunity applies to core duties and presumptive immunity to official acts, there is no immunity for private actions.  The court remanded Mr. Trump's case for further analysis based on these guidelines. Critics argue that this verdict undermines democratic accountability and allows presidents potential impunity for criminal acts.

The global goal of eradicating wild poliovirus type 1 (WPV1) by 2026 is facing challenges due to a resurgence of the virus in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  While the number of cases in 2023 appears lower than in 2022, an uptick in cases this year raises concerns.  

The circulation of the virus in the environment is increasing, with positive environmental samples detected in historical reservoirs in Pakistan, indicating a potential risk to gains made in polio eradication efforts. This resurgence is attributed to insufficient vaccine coverage, fake finger markings, and the movement of Afghan refugees, who may carry the virus.

The incident occurred when a large crowd, estimated at over 2.5 lakh, gathered to hear a preacher. Overcrowding and a rush to collect soil near the preacher are suspected to be the contributing factors. The tragedy exposed the lack of preparedness of the Uttar Pradesh administration, highlighting inadequate medical facilities and a slow response.

The first session of the 18th Lok Sabha saw a resurgence of parliamentary debate, despite clashes between the government and the Opposition. Rahul Gandhi, as the Leader of Opposition, sharply criticized the NDA government, prompting a similar response from Prime Minister Modi. Both sides reaffirmed their commitment to the Constitution while accusing each other of undermining it.  

The increased Opposition presence and return of coalition politics may strengthen Parliament's role. This includes enhanced scrutiny of bills by parliamentary committees and a potential check on the government's legislative agenda.  The session also saw the election of Om Birla as Speaker, with the Opposition securing the Deputy Speaker position.  Calls were made for impartiality from the Speaker and Rajya Sabha Chairman, along with a review of speech expunging practices.

India's core infrastructure sectors experienced a slowdown in May due to a severe heatwave.  Coal and electricity generation were the only sectors to show double-digit growth, while  production in crude oil,  fertilizers, and cement declined. The heatwave impacted construction and consumer demand for building materials, leading to contractions in cement and steel output. The persistent decline in fertilizer production signals a continued weakness in the agricultural sector. While the HSBC India Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) for June suggests a rebound in factory activity, inflationary pressures and slowing confidence in future output indicate that economic growth may face challenges. Policymakers will have an opportunity to address these challenges in the upcoming Union Budget.

Three new criminal laws have come into effect in India, replacing the Indian Penal Code, the Code of Criminal Procedure, and the Indian Evidence Act. Concerns have been raised about the preparedness of the police and judicial systems for this transition, with limited training and awareness provided. The new laws, named in Hindi, have been criticized for lacking adequate debate and public consultation. 

There are worries that provisions regarding police custody and the inclusion of 'terrorism' as a general criminal offence may increase police power and create confusion. While some procedural reforms are welcomed, overall uncertainty surrounds the potential impact of these new laws.

Iran is heading for a July 5th presidential runoff between reformist Masoud Pezeshkian and conservative Saeed Jalili after neither candidate secured 50% of the vote in the first round. Pezeshkian garnered 42.5% while Jalili received 38.8%. The election follows President Ebrahim Raisi's death in a helicopter crash and takes place amidst economic hardship, cultural restrictions, and international pressure regarding Iran's nuclear program and proxy groups. 

Although a new president can influence policy implementation, past reformist presidents have faced limitations due to the tight control exerted by the Shia clergy. 

This election saw a significantly lower voter turnout of 39.9%, highlighting growing public apathy and the limitations of Iran's political system. This trend, coupled with economic woes and repression, underscores the need for political and social reforms.

The bail granted to former Jharkhand Chief Minister Hemant Soren highlights concerns about the Enforcement Directorate's (ED) use of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The court's decision, based on a preliminary belief that Soren is not guilty, raises questions about the ED's practice of arresting political adversaries without solid evidence.  

The case against Soren stemmed from allegations of land irregularities. However, the court questioned the ED's claims, citing inconsistencies and lack of concrete evidence, such as no complaints from allegedly evicted landholders. It also criticized the agency's reliance on inferences and surmises, especially regarding Soren's alleged plans for the disputed land.  The bail decision underscores the need for greater scrutiny of the ED's actions and the potential for misuse of the PMLA for political purposes.

Key decisions included exempting hostel accommodations costing up to ₹20,000 a month and railway services from GST,  uniformizing the GST rate for certain items, waiving interest and penalty on tax dues for the first three years of GST, and  ending the anti-profiteering clause. 

The Council also plans to mandate Aadhaar authentication for GST registrations and is expected to revisit the 2021 plan to rationalize the GST rate structure, including incorporating items like petroleum and electricity into the GST net.

### [​Debt trap: On crisis in Kenya](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bdebt-trap-on-crisis-in-kenya/article68344717.ece)

Kenyan President William Ruto faced backlash for trying to quickly pass an IMF-backed bill that raised taxes on essential goods.  Protests erupted, resulting in casualties, prompting Ruto to withdraw the bill. The government aimed to raise billions in taxes to address Kenya's substantial debt burden, which accounts for a significant portion of the country's GDP.  The IMF deal triggered criticism as a third of Kenya's population lives in poverty. 

The crisis highlights challenges facing African nations that rely heavily on borrowing from international lenders.  The COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war exacerbated these issues, leading to heightened debt burdens and economic strain.  Kenya's debt situation calls for a balanced approach that addresses the needs of its citizens while ensuring responsible debt management.

### [​Unwarranted arrest: On the case of Arvind Kejriwal](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bunwarranted-arrest-on-the-case-of-arvind-kejriwal/article68340904.ece)

The arrest of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal by the CBI in the Delhi excise policy corruption case has raised concerns about its timing and potential bias. The arrest came just before the Supreme Court was set to hear an appeal against a Delhi High Court order that stayed Kejriwal's bail in a related money-laundering case. 

While the allegation against Kejriwal is serious, the investigation has been ongoing for two years and primarily relies on statements from pardoned accused persons. Critics argue that the circumstances surrounding the arrest suggest an attempt to prevent Kejriwal from securing bail and that the case highlights the weaponization of the judiciary against political opponents. They emphasize the need for impartial investigations and due process, while Kejriwal's supporters maintain that he is innocent and the arrest is politically motivated.

### [Net damage: On the fisheries dispute, India and Sri Lanka](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/net-damage-on-the-fisheries-dispute-india-and-sri-lanka/article68340694.ece)

The recent resumption of fishing off India’s eastern coast has resulted in the death of a Sri Lankan Navy sailor during an operation to stop Indian fishing boats in Sri Lankan waters. Ten fishermen,  including eight from Tamil Nadu and two from Andhra Pradesh, were apprehended. 

This incident has re-ignited the longstanding dispute between India and Sri Lanka regarding fishing rights. Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M.K. Stalin has requested the Indian External Affairs Minister to intervene in the release of the apprehended fishermen and their vessel.  The article highlights the need for renewed negotiations between the two countries to address the issue, considering the economic needs of the fishing communities and the need to protect the marine ecosystem.  It suggests promoting sustainable fishing practices like deep-sea fishing and alternative livelihoods for the fishermen.

### [​Lip service: On the Emergency and government’s actions](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Blip-service-on-the-emergency-and-governments-actions/article68336750.ece)

The article criticizes the recent actions of the Indian government, drawing parallels to the Emergency period of 1975-77. While  Lok Sabha Speaker Om Birla condemned the Emergency, the article argues that the government's current practices, such as suspending Opposition MPs and using draconian laws to silence dissent, mirror the excesses of that era.  

The article suggests that the recent electoral results, which reduced the ruling BJP's majority, indicate a rejection of these authoritarian tendencies. It calls for a stronger opposition, an independent judiciary, and a vigilant civil society to effectively counter such tendencies and prevent a recurrence of the Emergency's dark chapter in Indian history.

### [Ending defections: On politics in Telangana](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ending-defections-on-politics-in-telangana/article68336345.ece)

The defection of an MLA from the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) to the ruling Congress in Telangana has reduced the opposition's strength in the Assembly. Defections have plagued Indian politics since 2014.  While the Anti-Defection Law aims to curb this practice, its effectiveness is undermined by exceptions and the discretionary power vested with Speakers. This situation raises concerns about democratic principles and the need for a stronger opposition to ensure effective governance and checks on the ruling party.

### [Call for consensus: On the Prime Minister’s pledge and the 18th Lok Sabha](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/call-for-consensus-on-the-prime-ministers-pledge-and-the-18th-lok-sabha/article68332159.ece)

Prime Minister Modi called for consensus in governing despite the 18th Lok Sabha commencing amidst tension between the ruling NDA and the Opposition INDIA bloc. Both sides emphasize their commitment to the Constitution, but concrete convergence remains elusive.  The first session saw friction over the pro tem Speaker and a potential struggle for the Speaker’s post.  While the Opposition offered support for the NDA's candidate in exchange for the Deputy Speaker position, the BJP remains non-committal.  To foster true consensus, Mr. Modi must translate rhetoric into action, solidifying his authority through  interaction with opposition leaders and a commitment to power-sharing.  The new Lok Sabha should prioritize open debates, diverse viewpoints, and  constructive collaboration between ruling and opposition parties.
