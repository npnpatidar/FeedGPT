### [Shared blame: On Chennai and Cyclone Michaung](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/shared-blame-the-hindu-editoral-on-chennai-and-cyclone-michaung/article67607875.ece)

The article discusses the recent heavy rains and cyclone in Chennai, India, highlighting the challenges faced by the city in responding to natural disasters. On December 3rd, Cyclone Michaung brought heavy rainfall to Chennai, causing widespread flooding. The author emphasizes that blaming nature alone for such calamities is unfair and fails to address the underlying issues. The city's power infrastructure, for example, was not equipped to handle the situation, resulting in a precautionary power shutdown. The article also mentions the impact of unplanned construction, zoning violations, and public indiscipline on Chennai's ability to respond to storms. Climate change is likely contributing to stronger cyclones, but the city's response has been hindered by these long-standing problems. The article concludes by urging Chennai to prioritize improving sanitation workers' conditions, particularly those from marginalized communities. Overall, the article calls for faster progress in addressing these issues to ensure better disaster preparedness and response in the future.

### [Civic victory: On the Mizoram Assembly election results](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/civic-victory-on-the-mizoram-assembly-election-results/article67604996.ece)

The Zoram People's Movement (ZPM) emerged as the victor in the Mizoram Assembly Elections by winning a clear majority of 27 out of 40 seats. This victory is significant as it broke the 36-year-old duopoly between the Mizo National Front (MNF) and the Congress in the state. The ZPM faced challenges in defeating the MNF, which had promoted ethnic nationalism by aligning with tribal groups in Manipur and Myanmar. The Congress tried to appeal to the predominantly Christian population by highlighting the regional parties' potential alliance with the BJP, particularly the MNF's association with the BJP-led North East Democratic Alliance.

Despite these factors, a significant number of voters looked beyond ethnic nationalism and communitarian appeals and supported the ZPM. The party's focus on establishing a corruption-free government and prioritizing the interests of the youth resonated with the electorate. The ZPM succeeded in projecting itself as a force for change by gaining endorsements from prominent members of Mizoram's civil society.

While the ZPM now has the opportunity to implement its quasi-movement ideals as it comes to power independently, there may be overtures from the BJP to form a coalition government. The ZPM will need to navigate this delicate balance while striving for clean and independent governance and maintaining a positive relationship with the central government. Mizoram, being a smaller state with limited avenues for resource mobilization, heavily relies on Union transfers for its finances.

To achieve its promise of decisive change, the ZPM aims to diversify the state's economy beyond agriculture. It sees opportunities in areas such as eco-friendly tourism and value-added services, leveraging the high literacy rate and education of Mizoram's population. By focusing on these aspects, the ZPM can bring about the desired transformation in the state.

您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！您的免费额度不够使用这个模型啦，请点击右上角登录继续使用！The recent Israel-Hamas deal offers relief to the people of Gaza who have been suffering since October 7. The agreement involves the release of 50 civilian hostages by Hamas and the release of 150 Palestinian prisoners by Israel. Both sides will also cease fighting for four days, with the possibility of extending the pause if more hostages are released. However, the people of Gaza are calling for a lasting ceasefire and an end to the bombing, displacement, and denial of essential supplies. Israel initially refused to negotiate with Hamas but has now engaged in talks to free hostages. The article highlights that while the deal is a positive step, a full-fledged ceasefire is needed to provide lasting relief and ease tensions in the region.

The United Nations' latest report, titled "Broken Record," highlights the ongoing issue of rising greenhouse gas emissions. Despite commitments made by countries to reduce reliance on fossil fuels, the report suggests that temperatures could still exceed the desired limits set by the Paris Agreement. To stay below 2°C, emissions must be reduced by 28% by 2030, and for 1.5°C, a 42% reduction is needed. The report also emphasizes the need for greater and faster reductions from the wealthiest and historically responsible countries. The consequences of inaction are evident, with record-breaking temperatures and limited time to address the issue.

The Punjab and Haryana High Court has invalidated the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020, which mandated 75% reservation for state residents in private sector jobs with a monthly salary below ₹30,000. The court ruled that the state does not have the authority to legislate on this matter and restrict employers from hiring from the open market. It found the act to be in violation of the equality guaranteed under Article 14 and freedom under Article 19 of the Constitution. The court argued that such legislation hinders the rights of citizens from other parts of the country and could lead to the creation of "artificial walls" throughout India. Similar laws have been enacted in Andhra Pradesh and Jharkhand, but their constitutionality is yet to be determined. While there is resentment among locals in prosperous states about migrant workers taking their jobs, protecting local jobs through legislation is not the solution. Instead, efforts should focus on ensuring basic labor rights for all workers, regardless of their origin, to create a level playing field and curb exploitative practices by employers.

In the World Cup final between India and Australia, history repeated itself as Australia emerged victorious once again. Despite India's impressive performance throughout the tournament, winning 10 consecutive matches and defeating Australia earlier, they faltered in the final. The Australian team, led by Pat Cummins, showcased their dominance by winning their sixth World Cup title. The match was played on a slow pitch with dry spots, affecting India's batting performance. Although Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, and K.L. Rahul scored well, the rest of the team struggled with their timing. India's total of 240 runs proved insufficient as Australia successfully chased it down, thanks to Travis Head's remarkable century. Australia's exceptional fielding, including Head's diving catch to dismiss Rohit Sharma, played a crucial role in their victory. This win further solidified Australia's position as a leading cricket nation. Despite his Player of the Tournament award, Kohli found no solace in the defeat, and coach Rahul Dravid expressed empathy for his team. This World Cup might be the last for Indian stars such as Rohit Sharma, Virat Kohli, Ravindra Jadeja, and R. Ashwin, as they are unlikely to participate in the 2027 edition. Although India's drought of ICC titles since 2013 continues, there is no shame in this defeat, as the better team ultimately emerged victorious.

Javier Milei, a self-declared anarcho-capitalist, has been elected as the president of Argentina, marking a significant shift towards the right in the country's democracy. Milei's victory highlights the dissatisfaction with the center-left Peronist movement that has dominated Argentine politics for decades. The country is currently facing severe economic challenges, with high inflation, poverty rates, and a plummeting currency. Milei aims to "flatten" the political establishment, dismantle the central bank, and rebuild the economy. However, there are concerns about his far-right views and their potential impact on Argentina. He advocates for replacing the national currency with the US dollar, banning abortion, and restructuring public healthcare and education systems. Milei's admiration for Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro also raises concerns. While he may face challenges in implementing his radical promises due to limited legislative support, his confrontational approach could weaken Argentina's democracy and exacerbate its economic problems. This election marks a testing time for Argentina, the second-largest country in South America.

The article criticizes the Tamil Nadu Governor's decision to withhold assent to Bills concerning universities in the state, calling it a gross abuse of power. The Bills aim to transfer the power to appoint Vice-Chancellors from the Governor to the State government. The rejection of the Bills is seen as a response to the Supreme Court's remarks on Governors delaying assent to Bills. The article questions whether the Governor is bound to grant assent if the same Bills are reconsidered and passed again. It also highlights the undemocratic and anti-federal feature in the Constitution that allows Governors to reject legislation passed by elected representatives. The Court is urged to examine whether this violates parliamentary democracy.

The ongoing Assembly elections in five states in India are being viewed as a precursor to the general election in 2024. The elections have concluded in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, and Mizoram, while campaigning is underway in Rajasthan and Telangana. The main focus of campaigning so far has been competitive populism, with both the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress making promises of various welfare schemes. The Congress in Telangana has vowed to expand the state's welfare regime, while the BJP and Congress in Rajasthan and Madhya Pradesh, respectively, are relying on new welfare architectures for their campaigns. The response to the Congress's demand for a caste-based census has been mixed. Both the BJP and Congress have shown attention to tribal voters, with Prime Minister Narendra Modi launching a special welfare scheme for Particularly Vulnerable Tribal Groups. The BJP campaign has centered around Mr. Modi, while the Congress has empowered its regional leaders to steer the campaign strategy. The outcome of these elections will have an impact on the formation of the opposition coalition ahead of the 2024 general elections.

The recent summit meeting between U.S. President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping in San Francisco did not resolve major differences between the two countries, but it did provide some relief by stabilizing the relationship. The summit resulted in concrete agreements to restart military-to-military dialogue and discuss artificial intelligence risks. Both sides also described establishing a floor to the relationship, building on the previous Bali consensus. However, the stability may be short-lived, as Taiwan's upcoming elections and the U.S. presidential campaign season could increase tensions. The fundamental question of whether the U.S. and China are adversaries or partners remains a point of difference, but both sides recognize the importance of high-level engagement and open channels to prevent conflict. This offers lessons for the India-China relationship as well.

The World Cup final between India and Australia will take place at the Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad. India is in good form, having won 10 consecutive matches, while Australia started with two losses but then won eight games in a row. Australia has won the World Cup five times and will be looking to live up to their legacy. The last time India and Australia met in a World Cup final was in 2003, with Australia emerging as the winners. Rahul Dravid, who played in that match, is now the coach of the Indian team. Both Dravid and captain Rohit Sharma are focused on taking it one match at a time. India has been performing well in the championship, with strong batting performances from Rohit Sharma, Shubman Gill, Virat Kohli, and others, as well as a strong bowling attack led by Jasprit Bumrah. However, Australia remains a competitive team with players like Glenn Maxwell and an effective bowling attack. India will need to tackle these challenges well in order to win the World Cup for the third time.

The article discusses the ongoing ethnic conflict in Manipur between the Meitei and Kuki-Zo communities. Despite the passage of six months since the violent conflagration that fueled the conflict, little progress has been made in bridging the divide or reducing hostility. Both sides continue to engage in provocative actions, further widening the divide. The Indigenous Tribal Leaders Forum (ITLF), representing Kuki-Zo groups, recently announced its pursuit of "self-rule" with a separate "chief minister" in districts dominated by the tribal community. This move, without legal basis, is likely to anger Meiteis, who have grievances regarding special land ownership rights. The announcement also comes after a visit by intelligence bureau and ministry of home affairs officials, suggesting a lack of government control in Manipur. The central government has not made any leadership changes in the state government, relying on paramilitary forces and Article 355 provisions to maintain peace. However, this approach has worsened the divide and failed to initiate dialogue for lasting peace. The article suggests that a change in the Bharatiya Janata Party's central leadership strategy is necessary to address the conflict in Manipur effectively.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.A coordinated offensive by Myanmar's ethnic rebels against the junta indicates that the coup regime is facing challenges. The Three Brotherhood Alliance, a coalition of armed groups, has claimed territorial gains on Myanmar's border with China and has seen junta forces surrender. Clashes have also occurred in Rakhine State and Chin State, bordering India. In response to setbacks, the junta has carried out air strikes, resulting in civilian casualties. Since the military coup in February 2021, over 4,000 civilians and pro-democracy activists have been killed, and 20,000 people have been jailed. The junta's violence has not stabilized the country. The pro-democracy movement has shifted from peaceful resistance to forming an underground government and joining forces with ethnic rebels. The rebels have made territorial gains and maintained pressure on the junta. The junta is facing regional isolation and does not have easy options. The rebels have called for the generals to retreat from politics and engage in talks for a federal democratic system with greater autonomy for ethnic minority regions. Regional players, including ASEAN, should play a more proactive role in achieving a ceasefire and restoring democracy in Myanmar.

Wholesale prices also declined by 0.5%. However, rural consumers still face a higher inflation rate of 5.1%. Core inflation, excluding energy and food costs, has continued to ease, and household services inflation dropped below 4%. The rise in vegetable prices slowed to 2.7% in October, but overall food costs remained firm at 6.6%, with pulses and cereals seeing significant price hikes. These increases may be due to concerns about crop output and minimum support prices. The Reserve Bank of India's monetary policy committee, which meets early December for its next review, is not likely to be influenced significantly by October's inflation figures. Looking ahead, average inflation for November and December is projected to be around 5.95%, close to the central bank's upper tolerance threshold. The retreat of inflation last month may only be temporary, as tight consumer spending may persist due to rising living costs. Reluctant or budget-cramped consumers pose a challenge to policymakers aiming to boost domestic demand and maintain economic resilience.

### [Life over death: On death penalty abolition and parliamentary panel report](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/life-over-death-the-hindu-editorial-on-death-penalty-abolition-and-parliamentary-panel-report/article67536304.ece)

The parliamentary committee examining the proposed Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS), a potential replacement for the Indian Penal Code (IPC), has disappointed by not recommending the abolition of the death penalty. Instead, the committee suggested leaving the decision to the government. Experts and jurists advocating for abolition presented compelling arguments, including the increased reliance on death sentences by trial courts while the Supreme Court leaned away from capital punishment. They also highlighted that the death penalty had no deterrent effect and that global opinion favored its abolition. From 2007 to 2022, the Supreme Court only awarded the death penalty to seven individuals, and all death sentences in 2023 were either set aside or commuted to life imprisonment as they did not meet the criteria of being "rarest of rare cases."

Dissenting members of the committee supported the argument that capital punishment was not a deterrent and that life imprisonment would be a more rigorous punishment with potential for reform. They also emphasized that most death row inmates came from underprivileged backgrounds. If Parliament proceeds with enacting the draft Bills, it should reconsider retaining the death penalty. The BNS defines "life imprisonment" as remaining in prison for the convict's natural life, which should be the default alternative to death sentences. The case for abolition would strengthen if premature release of life convicts for political reasons is halted and life terms without remission become more common. Remission should be a humanitarian act, free from political controversy. Removing capital punishment from the statute book and implementing a rational and universal remission policy would be a significant reform in the justice system.

India's stance on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict has raised confusion and questions. While India abstained from a UN General Assembly resolution calling for a ceasefire in the Israeli strikes on Gaza, it recently voted in favor of five out of six annual draft resolutions that criticized Israel for increasing settlements in occupied territories. The government's explanation of these votes as routine has only added to the confusion. India had previously stated it could not vote for a resolution that did not explicitly condemn attacks by Hamas, but none of the resolutions referred to these attacks. India also did not propose amendments or speak during the committee deliberations. This has raised concerns about India's willingness to make a difference and play a role in alleviating the conflict. The upcoming Voice of Global South and G-20 virtual summits may provide an opportunity for India to express its position and articulate options for ending the violence and recovering Israeli hostages. The article emphasizes the importance of India's voice in such matters and the need for it not to be replaced by silence.

The Supreme Court has directed the Union government to establish guidelines for protecting the interests of media professionals when it comes to the seizure of their digital devices. Recent incidents where journalists' laptops and smartphones were seized and searched have raised concerns about the freedom of the press and the ability of journalists to do their job effectively. These actions not only affect the wider media community but also discourage whistle-blowers and those who provide information on the condition of anonymity. The guidelines should ensure that law enforcement agencies cannot seize or search devices without a prior judicial warrant and must clearly outline the information they expect to find. Journalists should not be forced to incriminate themselves or their sources by providing passcodes or biometric data. Protocols should be in place to protect the devices and data from leaks, tampering, or being passed on to third parties. Data irrelevant to an investigation should be deleted promptly, and technological interventions should allow for the cloning of a device so journalists can continue their work. It is crucial to create a record of the device at the time of seizure to prevent the planting of incriminating material during the investigation process. The guidelines should be transparent and involve public consultations, considering that privacy is considered a fundamental right. Furthermore, there is a need to update laws related to search and seizure to address the challenges presented by digital devices.

The index of industrial production (IIP) in India rose by 5.8% in September, a slower growth compared to the 10.3% growth in August. This was below economists' expectations of a 7% to 8% increase during the festive season. Manufacturing saw a decline in growth from 9.3% in August to 4.5% in September, with some sectors experiencing a drop in production levels. Consumer goods output was only 0.3% higher than pre-pandemic levels in September. On the other hand, investment-linked sectors like infrastructure and construction goods showed more resilience. Going forward, the balance between investment and consumption will be crucial for economic growth in India.

The Indian team has been performing exceptionally well, winning nine consecutive matches and topping the league phase. They are now facing New Zealand in the semifinals. The article also mentions that despite the absence of injured all-rounder Hardik Pandya, the Indian team has shown great form, both in batting and bowling. The article also mentions the other semifinalists, Australia and South Africa, and highlights the growth of teams like Afghanistan and the Netherlands in the tournament. The article concludes by mentioning that the cricket world needs these teams to evolve to widen its footprints.

The Lok Sabha Ethics Committee's recommendation to expel Trinamool Congress MP Mahua Moitra from the lower House is seen as a partisan attempt to silence a government critic and intimidate MPs from holding the executive accountable. The committee's conclusions lack solid evidence and go against principles of natural justice. If MPs are barred from sharing login credentials, this rule should apply to all. The selective investigation of one MP based on insinuations and conjectures is seen as intimidation. The committee's response to a complaint against a BJP MP who made derogatory remarks was tardy in comparison. While Moitra's actions show a lack of discretion, it should serve as a lesson for those seeking to hold the government accountable.

The article discusses the issue of ragging, or hazing, on college campuses in India. Despite legislation and regulations banning ragging, incidents continue to occur, with victims experiencing physical and mental abuse. The article highlights the need for preventive measures rather than just prohibition, and calls for greater accountability from educational institutions and regulatory authorities. The article emphasizes the importance of creating a safe and supportive environment for students and urges the government to take action to ensure the safety of students on campuses.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The article discusses the under-utilization of funds for production-linked incentives (PLI) for manufacturing semiconductors in India. While the PLI scheme for IT hardware has a ₹17,000 crore outlay, the one for semiconductors and displays has ₹38,601 crore earmarked. However, the article questions the effectiveness of these schemes in terms of employment and value addition. It mentions that manufacturing facilities employ few people despite the value generated in sales, and it highlights the importance of attracting an "ecosystem" to increase the value addition of India's electronics manufacturing sector. The article suggests that efforts should be made to encourage semiconductor design talent domestically. It also raises concerns about the limited scope of the PLI funds and the reluctance of multinational chipmakers to make substantive commitments. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for clarity on the desired outcomes of these schemes and the importance of tangible results before massive PLI spending takes place.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The Supreme Court of India has given the government four weeks to finalize a menstrual hygiene policy that focuses on the distribution of sanitary napkins. The court also directed the government to establish a national model for the number of girls' toilets in schools. While India has made progress in improving menstrual hygiene, affordability and access remain issues, particularly in rural areas. The latest National Family Health Survey shows that 73% of rural women and 90% of urban women use hygienic methods of menstrual protection. Education plays a significant role in promoting hygiene practices, with women who have received more schooling being more likely to use hygienic methods. The lack of action on this issue for so many years is seen as callous. The government must ensure access to affordable menstrual hygiene products, clean toilets, and water for all menstruating girls. The policy should also address the health and social consequences of menstruation.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.The ongoing case before the Kerala High Court regarding the restriction of negative film reviews in the first few days of release raises important questions about free speech. The court is tasked with distinguishing genuine film criticism from attempts to harm a film's success through malicious comments or extortion. While the court recognizes the potential impact on free speech and freedom of expression, it remains to be seen how it will balance the interests of filmmakers and reviewers. Film director Mubeen Rauf has petitioned the court to prevent social media influencers and film vloggers from publishing reviews of his film for at least seven days after release. The court's recent order emphasizes the need to prevent anonymous malicious content circulation and suggests taking necessary action under relevant laws. The court also notes the unintended positive consequence of the case, as the petitioner's film gained success at the box office due to the absence of "review bombing." The union government is expected to respond, but caution is advised to ensure that the freedom to critically analyze a film and the art of criticism are not curtailed.

The Indian government has extended the free foodgrains scheme, known as the Pradhan Mantri Garib Kalyan Anna Yojana (PMGKAY), for the next five years. This scheme provides food security to vulnerable populations, benefiting about 80.4 crore people. The provision of free foodgrains was initially introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic and has been extended since then. However, the way in which the announcement was made by Prime Minister Narendra Modi at an election rally raises questions about a violation of the model code of conduct. Despite this, the extension of the scheme is expected to have manageable fiscal implications and it is important for the government to ensure that the benefits reach those who deserve them by eliminating leakages in the Public Distribution System.

India and Bhutan have agreed to focus on infrastructure and connectivity, which could have significant regional implications. The plans include the construction of rail links between Bhutan and Assam and West Bengal, as well as the facilitation of trade between Bhutan and Bangladesh. These initiatives aim to boost Bhutan's economy, which has been heavily impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic and concerns over global warming. Additionally, a Preferential Trade Agreement between Bhutan and Bangladesh could increase exports and create more markets in the sub-region. India's "energy exchange" project, which involves hydropower suppliers from Bhutan and Nepal, could also drive growth and revenues in the region. Efficient execution of these plans is crucial, especially considering India's challenges with Pakistan and Myanmar. Building connectivity, markets, and energy links with neighboring countries is seen as a sustainable way forward. These initiatives could enhance security and prosperity for all involved, with particular benefits for Bhutan, which has been a trusted partner of India in the region.

The article discusses the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza, which has entered its second month. The UN has described Gaza as a "graveyard for thousands of children" and "a living hell for everyone else." According to the Gaza health ministry, at least 10,000 people, including many women and children, have been killed in Israel's attacks. The Israeli bombing has also displaced 1.5 million people and led to the destruction of infrastructure and buildings. The UN has called for a ceasefire and respect for international humanitarian laws, but Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected these calls. Israeli troops have encircled Gaza City and are engaged in street battles with militants, aiming to topple the Hamas government. The article highlights that Israel's actions could have disastrous consequences for the region, and calls for the US to intervene and pressure Israel to cease fire and protect Palestinian civilians.

The article discusses the ongoing conflict between Israel and Gaza, which has now entered its second month. The UN has described Gaza as a "graveyard for thousands of children" and "a living hell for everyone else." The Gaza Health Ministry reports that at least 10,000 people, including women and children, have been killed by Israel's bombing campaign. The attack has also displaced 1.5 million people. Despite calls for a ceasefire and respect for international humanitarian laws, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has rejected these appeals. Israeli troops have encircled Gaza city and are engaged in street battles with militants, aiming to topple the Hamas government, eliminate its commanders, destroy its military infrastructure, and rescue hostages taken by Hamas. If Israel continues its assault, it could have disastrous consequences for the region, as demonstrated by attacks launched by Yemen's Houthis and the tense situation on the Israeli-Lebanese border. The article highlights that the United States has the ability to rein in Israel but is yet to take action. It urges the U.S. to demonstrate moral leadership and pressure Israel to cease fire immediately.

The article discusses the trend of politicians in India switching parties just before elections. It states that electoral politics in India has become costly, resulting in parties selecting candidates who can mobilize resources for campaigns. This has led to a group of politicians who prioritize patronage and career-building over ideological conviction. The article argues that this system of patronage is less representative of the interests and demands of constituents and more of a transaction between the politician and the voter. Additionally, the article highlights the impact of defections on the Indian National Congress party, which has lost prominence to the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) due to large-scale defections. The Congress party has attempted to distinguish itself by positioning as a vehicle for welfare through electoral guarantees, attracting defections from the BJP and regional parties in states such as Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Telangana. However, retaining these flexible legislators poses a challenge. The article concludes that defections will continue to be a feature of Indian politics unless voters penalize those who frequently switch parties.

The article discusses the annual air quality inflection point in Delhi and surrounding states, which occurs when the southwest monsoon recedes and pollutants from various human activities become trapped in the atmosphere. Despite efforts to address the crisis, the air pollution situation has reached a stalemate. The Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) is limited in its powers to address the causes of air pollution. While there has been some improvement in air quality in Delhi from January to October, November remains a critical month for pollution. Stubble burning, vehicular pollution, and construction dust are identified as major challenges that need to be addressed. The article emphasizes the need for a concerted approach and greater coordination and compliance to tackle the pollution challenges in November.

### [Revenue rebound: On GST collections](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/revenue-rebound-on-gst-collections/article67501047.ece)

In October, India's Gross Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenues reached their second-highest monthly total, surpassing ₹1.72 lakh crore. This reflects a 13.4% increase compared to the previous year and reverses a deceleration in revenue growth seen in the second quarter of the financial year. The Finance Ministry hopes that this growth rate will continue to provide a buffer for any potential spending or subsidy shocks. The increase in revenues may be attributed to the Revenue Department's crackdown on non-compliance and a deadline for settling disputes related to the GST regime. There are also indications of a recovery in domestic demand, with revenues from domestic transactions and services imports growing by 13%. This marks the fastest uptick in at least nine months and suggests a rebound in discretionary demand, particularly for premium or high-end goods. A new amnesty scheme for settling limited GST demands may further bolster revenues. It is important to consider these factors when assessing the economy's growth prospects.

Two states, Tamil Nadu and Kerala, have approached the Supreme Court of India to challenge the conduct of their Governors. They are concerned about the delay in granting assent to Bills passed by the legislature and the failure to act on proposals related to remission for convicts, prosecution of former Ministers, and appointments to the State Public Service Commissions. Some Governors, particularly in states not governed by the ruling party at the Centre, are accused of blocking decisions and Bills. There is a need to prohibit Governors from being burdened with the role of chancellor of any university. The absence of a time-frame for giving assent is being used by some Governors to stymie laws passed by the legislature. The Supreme Court has reminded constitutional authorities that they should not indefinitely hold on to Bills without conveying a decision. The States should also be prudent in their decision-making and ensure a fair process for appointing officials. Governors are restricted in their functioning by the 'aid and advice' clause in the Constitution and should not misuse their discretionary power.

The Tamil Nadu government has decided to establish a fact-checking unit to address misinformation and disinformation related to the state government. This move follows a similar decision by the Karnataka government. However, the article argues that allowing governments to determine what is false or not is problematic, as it creates a conflict of interest. The article also mentions the Centre's notification of the IT Rules, which allows the Ministry of Electronics and IT to appoint a fact-checking unit. The Bombay High Court has raised concerns about the lack of necessary safeguards and the potential infringement on freedom of speech and expression. The verdict on the matter is set to be delivered on December 1. The article suggests that independent bodies and journalists should be involved in addressing misinformation and fake news, rather than relying solely on government-appointed units.

The latest data shows a slowdown in economic momentum in India. The growth in production across key infrastructure industries eased to a four-month low in September, with only fertilizers showing an increase in growth. Heavy rains and dampened demand contributed to the slowing growth in cement, electricity, and steel. Additionally, the manufacturing sector also experienced a decline in growth, with new orders rising at the slowest pace in a year. Job creation in manufacturing also slowed, and input cost inflation accelerated. Business confidence is at a five-month low, and rising inflation expectations are expected to impact demand and production growth in the future. The lower kharif output also poses challenges for the farm sector. Policymakers will need to address the challenges of slowing growth and persistent inflation.

### [Scapegoating: On Afghan refugees in Pakistan](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/scapegoating-on-afghan-refugees-in-pakistan/article67485207.ece)

The Pakistan government has ordered all undocumented migrants, including Afghan refugees, to leave the country by October 31. This decision has put the lives of hundreds of thousands of Afghan refugees at risk. While the government claims that the order is not targeted at any specific nationality, it is clear that Afghan refugees are the main focus. Pakistan's Interior Ministry states that around 1.7 million people are staying in the country illegally, with the majority being Afghans. The government has set up deportation centers to round up and deport these migrants, leading to a humanitarian crisis. Pakistan argues that the presence of illegal migrants has led to rising crime and terror attacks, as well as straining the struggling economy. However, forcefully deporting 1.7 million people is not a solution to these problems. The responsibility for these issues lies with Pakistan's rulers, who neglected the economy and pursued a dual policy on terrorism. By scapegoating Afghan refugees, Pakistan is avoiding accountability for its own failures.

The article discusses the recent alert sent by Apple to over a dozen Opposition leaders and journalists, notifying them that their devices were targeted by "state-sponsored attackers." This raises concerns about potential surveillance and the use of spyware, similar to the Pegasus episode. In 2022, it was revealed that Pegasus, a spyware developed by the NSO Group, was used by various countries, including India, to target Opposition leaders, journalists, and dissidents. While a Supreme Court panel in India found no conclusive evidence of spyware on the examined phones, it noted the lack of cooperation from the government. Unlike India, other Western governments took strict measures following the revelations on spyware use. Apple's iPhones, known for their security provisions, have been targeted by spyware like Pegasus since 2016. Apple has released updates to fix these exploits and has sued NSO. However, the specific targeting of Opposition leaders and journalists raises questions about potential surveillance by the ruling establishment. An independent investigation, involving the apex court, is necessary to verify this. The government should also disclose its dealings with NSO and follow the steps taken by other governments to restrict such entities.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to unveil a plan called Vision India@2047 in early 2024, which aims to transform India into a developed nation with a $30 trillion economy by the time it completes 100 years of Independence. The plan has been in the works for two years and will be reviewed by top minds across sectors to fine-tune its ideas and goals. The plan should focus on navigating challenging reforms, ensuring policy certainty for global investors, and shifting the economy from farms to factories. It should also be revisited periodically to adjust goals based on global trends and events.

The Supreme Court of India has set deadlines for the Maharashtra Assembly Speaker to decide on petitions seeking the disqualification of members who have broken away from the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party. The court's decision is a welcome sign of judicial assertion, as Speakers often show bias based on their political affiliations. The court has asked the Speaker to decide on the disqualification petitions against Chief Minister Eknath Shinde's camp by December 31 and those concerning the NCP's breakaway group by January 31, 2024. The court's directions follow a previous decision in May 2023, where the Speaker was asked to decide the disqualification issue "within a reasonable period." The Speaker has had enough time to decide the matter, and even without judicial orders, the issue of disqualification should not be dealt with leisurely or in a partisan manner. The court has observed a growing trend of Speakers acting against their constitutional duty of being neutral, and in some cases, the court has had to intervene and remove ministers from office. As long as the Speaker has the authority to adjudicate disqualification issues, it will be challenging to separate matters of defection from politics.

India abstained from voting for a ceasefire in the Israel-Palestine conflict at the UN General Assembly due to the omission of explicit condemnation of the October 7 terror attack by Hamas militants on Israel. While India's principled stand on terrorism is commendable, the rising death toll and the need for global solidarity to stop the violence make it imperative for New Delhi to play a more active role. India had the option to propose an amendment to the resolution to include mention of the October 7 attacks or to vote for the motion while expressing regret for the omissions. However, India's abstention indicates a shift in its stance and a missed opportunity to make its voice heard in the growing geopolitical conflict. This decision is out of sync with India's desire to be a global leader and advocate for the Global South.

### [Terror in bags: On the blasts in Kerala](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/terror-in-bags-on-the-blasts-in-kerala/article67477512.ece)

A series of explosions occurred at a convention of Jehovah's Witnesses in Kerala, India, resulting in three deaths and 50 injuries. A man named Martin Dominic claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that he was an estranged member of the sect and targeted them for "propagating anti-national sentiments." He later surrendered to the police with evidence supporting his claims. However, the use of improvised explosive devices raised concerns, leading to the formation of a special investigation team. In the aftermath of the blasts, there was a wave of speculation and communal tension fueled by social media posts. Some individuals accused Kerala of harboring terrorists, which resulted in a heated exchange between a Union Minister and the Chief Minister of Kerala. The police have arrested Martin and charged him under anti-terror laws. If his claims are true, it highlights a deeper social issue.

A parliamentary committee is close to finalizing its report on three Bills that aim to replace existing criminal laws in India. The report has been postponed due to demands from Opposition members for more time to study it. There are dissenting notes on the text of two of the Bills, while the third Bill has unanimous support. The committee has faced criticism for the limited time and consultations involved in the scrutiny process. The demand for more time to examine the report arose because it was circulated in English only, with the Hindi version made available shortly before the meeting. The government wants to introduce and pass the Bills during the winter session of Parliament, but there are calls for more time to scrutinize certain aspects of the proposed laws, such as the potential for misuse and the need for procedural reform in the criminal justice system.

The ED's investigation is based on cases filed by the Rajasthan police regarding the alleged leak of a competitive examination paper. The article highlights the perception of selective targeting of opposition leaders by the ED and the BJP's claim that these actions are to root out corruption. It also mentions the BJP's increasing friction within its ranks and the Congress' accusation of the ED's actions being a sign of the BJP's frustration. The article raises concerns about the impartiality of the ED's actions and the potential impact on governance and democracy.

In a shocking development, a Qatari court has handed down a death sentence to eight Indians accused of espionage. The trial, which started in August 2022, has been shrouded in secrecy, with little information about the charges and evidence against the former Indian navy servicemen. Despite pleas from their families and Indian diplomats, Qatar has not explained why it has withheld details of the case. Leaked reports suggest that the men were accused of sharing secret information related to the stealth submarine program they worked on with a third country, a charge their families deny. The situation poses a significant test for the Indian government's diplomatic skills, as India's ties with Qatar have been relatively good, including strategic and defense cooperation agreements. India also sources 40% of its LNG needs from Qatar, and 700,000 Indian expatriates are an integral part of Qatar's institutions and workforce. The government must now take immediate steps to ensure the Indians receive the best possible support in their appeal. They should activate channels to the Qatari leadership at the highest levels, including the prime minister if necessary, and make a case for clemency and commuting the sentences to jail terms that could be served in India. The government must demonstrate that the men's lives are a priority and that they adhere to their policy of "no Indian left behind."

The article discusses the return of former prime minister Nawaz Sharif to Pakistan and the political dynamics surrounding his comeback. After being ousted from power and going into exile, Sharif has now returned, possibly with the support of the military, ahead of the general elections. His party, the PML-N, hopes that his return will revive their political fortunes and help them defeat their main rival, Imran Khan. However, Sharif faces challenges such as the worsening economic situation and the need to gain the support of the military, which could undermine civilian institutions. The article highlights the cyclical nature of Pakistan's political landscape, where politicians align with the military to gain power, only to be sidelined later.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has maintained its 6.5% GDP growth projection for the year, despite risks from geopolitical tensions, economic fragmentation, volatile financial markets, and an uneven monsoon. However, the RBI governor has indicated that new uncertainties have emerged, including the Israel-Hamas conflict and rising US bond yields. Disruptions or price spikes in fuel and fertilizer imports could negatively impact India's macro-economic framework. The finance ministry remains optimistic about the economy, stating that growth is on track, inflation is easing, consumption demand is strengthening, and investment demand is firming up. However, they should pay attention to consumption and hiring trends to correct an uneven recovery and stimulate broader investment.

The US House of Representatives has elected Representative Mike Johnson of Louisiana as the new Speaker after weeks of struggle to find a consensus candidate. The selection process signaled serious deadlock and division within the Republican party. The fractures within the party reflect the divide between those who support former President Donald Trump and those who do not. This division could potentially pose a challenge for the party in the 2024 presidential election. Additionally, the article suggests that the dissonances within the Republican party might manifest in popular anger among conservatives, which could hinder Trump's political ambitions.

Bhutan's foreign minister, Tandi Dorji, visited China this week, marking the first-ever visit by a Bhutanese foreign minister and the first boundary talks between the two countries in over seven years. The talks resulted in substantive progress, with both countries signing a cooperation agreement for the delimitation and demarcation of their boundary. China's foreign minister called for the establishment of diplomatic relations and the conclusion of boundary negotiations. Despite concerns from India, Bhutan's prime minister stated that the two countries are progressing towards a boundary agreement that aligns with India's interests. Bhutan's dependence on India suggests that it will involve India in its efforts to normalize relations with China, guaranteeing India's security interests. India's challenge now is to protect its interests by aligning strategies with Bhutan. India should approach the boundary negotiations with greater understanding of Bhutan's viewpoint and confidence that Bhutan will consider both its own interests and India's before reaching a final agreement.

Poland's right-wing Law and Justice party, in power since 2015, was punished by voters in the recent parliamentary election. The party, known as PiS, has shifted Poland's politics to the right and clashed with the European Union. It has been accused of undermining democracy, stifling the free press, and seizing control of institutions. PiS emerged as the largest party but fell short of a governing majority. The centrist opposition Civic Coalition, led by Donald Tusk, has the potential to form a government with coalition partners. Tusk has promised to mend relations with the EU, strengthen democracy, and restore gay rights. However, he faces challenges in forming a government and reaching consensus with President Andrzej Duda, who wields a legislative veto. Tusk also needs to address differing views within his coalition on economic and climate policies. Additionally, he must navigate Poland's strategic role in the Russia-Ukraine crisis.

The article discusses the surprising performances of Afghanistan and the Netherlands in the ICC World Cup. Afghanistan has shown that they are competitive and not to be underestimated, despite losses to Bangladesh, India, and New Zealand. The roots of Afghan cricket can be traced back to refugee camps in Pakistan, providing a welcome distraction for children. The rise of the Taliban posed challenges, but the Afghan cricketers remain beacons of hope. The Netherlands, with their Dutch colonized connection, pulled off an upset against South Africa. Despite losing other games, their talent is evident. Meanwhile, India, led by Rohit Sharma and Virat Kohli, has shown good form and is close to securing a semifinal berth. Small margins will determine big shifts in the coming weeks, and England's slide to the bottom of the standings is surprising. Overall, India is currently in a strong position in the tournament.

The Indian National Developmental, Inclusive Alliance (INDIA), a bloc of 28 parties aiming to displace the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) in 2024, is struggling to maintain a united front in the upcoming assembly elections in five states. No seat sharing agreements have been announced with smaller parties in Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Telangana, where the Congress is a key contender. In some states, parties like the Samajwadi Party and Aam Aadmi Party are disappointed with the Congress. The lack of unity is due to structural and tactical issues, as many regional parties were originally formed in opposition to the Congress. Furthermore, internal dynamics within the Congress are creating obstacles to seat sharing. The bad blood created during this election cycle may also undermine unity efforts leading up to the 2024 contest. The bloc's coordination panels are facing challenges as constituents have diverging views on key issues. To present a viable alternative to the BJP, a stronger Congress and greater trust and understanding among party leaders are needed.

The launch tested the crew-escape system (CES) and collected data for future tests. The mission, which has faced delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic, aims to launch humans to orbit by 2025. Prime Minister Narendra Modi has also called on ISRO to launch humans to the moon by 2040. The article emphasizes the importance of thorough testing and planning to ensure the safety and success of these missions.

India and Canada's strained relationship seems to be deteriorating further, as India has reduced the number of Canadian diplomats in the country from 62 to 21. Canada has accused India of having a role in the killing of a Canadian national, and India has retaliated by suspending visas for all Canadians and demanding a downsizing of Canadian diplomatic presence. Canada has criticized India's demand as a violation of international law, and as a result, it has flown out 41 diplomats and their families. Previous diplomatic efforts to defuse the situation have not been successful, and it is unclear how the impasse will be resolved. Students, tourists, and businesspersons are expected to be negatively affected by the strained relations.

The recent referendum in Australia on the voice for Indigenous Australians was rejected by voters with a 60% margin. The referendum aimed to establish a body that would advise the country's parliament on laws impacting the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders people. The idea came from the historic 2017 Uluru Statement from the Heart, which called for a treaty between the Australian government and the Indigenous community and a commission to promote truth-telling about history. Supporters of the voice believed it would address the disadvantages faced by Indigenous people, such as shorter life expectancy, lower healthcare and education attainments, and higher incarceration rates. Critics, however, argued that the voice would divide Australians along racial lines and potentially lead to compensation and reparation claims. The 'no' campaign advocates emphasized that Indigenous people already had fair representation in parliament. While the prime minister has called for unity, the missed opportunity to advance the conversation on building a more harmonious future for all Australians highlights the ongoing challenges faced by Indigenous peoples in achieving justice and equal socioeconomic progress.

The author criticizes Israel's disproportionate use of force, causing the deaths of thousands of Palestinians, including many children. The article also mentions the visits of US President Joe Biden and British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak to Israel, where they expressed support for Israel's right to defend itself. The author highlights the insufficient amount of humanitarian aid being provided to Gaza and criticizes Israel's approach to dealing with the Palestinian issue. The article concludes by stating that Israel is likely to continue its attacks without facing consequences, further exacerbating the suffering of Palestinians.

The Allahabad High Court has acquitted two men accused of killing girls and young women in Nithari Village near Delhi. The court's verdict criticizes the investigators for building a case without credible evidence and relying solely on confessions. The case, which involved the discovery of body parts and bones behind the accused's house, was poorly investigated by the police and the Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI). The confession made by one of the accused was ruled invalid due to the circumstances under which it was obtained. The prosecution's case, which claimed that the accused lured and killed the victims, engaged in sexual acts with their bodies, and ate body parts, was also deemed questionable. The judgment raises concerns about the investigation's failure to interrogate a doctor arrested in the past for involvement in illegal organ trade and the absence of complete human remains in the evidence. This case highlights the importance of relying on credible evidence rather than the shock value and media attention surrounding a crime.

The article discusses the easing of inflation faced by consumers in September. After a sharp increase in prices in July, inflation has now returned to the Reserve Bank of India's tolerance range of 2% to 6%. The article notes that while the preferred inflation rate is 4%, the bank's estimate for average inflation between July and September is 6.4%. However, projections from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank suggest that inflation may continue to rise. The article also highlights that food inflation has decreased, but certain items like pulses, fruits, eggs, and sugar have seen an increase. Rural inflation remains higher than urban inflation, and uncertainties about the impact of the monsoon and the El Niño effect on crops are a concern. The article concludes by pointing out the potential for inflation to rise due to global oil and gas prices and increased prices for imported goods like urea.

Hmm, I'm sorry, but I am only able to provide information and support related to Chatbase. If you have any questions or need assistance with Chatbase, feel free to ask!The article discusses the recent commencement of a passenger ferry service between Kankesanthurai in Sri Lanka and Nagapattinam in Tamil Nadu. This marks the revival of a sea link that had been disrupted by Sri Lanka's civil war. The article highlights the potential benefits of this ferry service, including strengthening cultural and economic ties, improving cooperation in disaster management and maritime security, and enabling the voluntary repatriation of refugees from Sri Lanka. However, to ensure the success of this service, certain measures need to be taken, such as increasing the baggage allowance, providing amenities at Nagapattinam port, and improving rail connectivity. The article emphasizes the importance of sustained policy attention from both the governments involved to prevent this ferry service from meeting the fate of previous unsuccessful attempts.

The Supreme Court of India has refused to recognize same-sex marriages, which is considered a setback for the queer community. Despite the progress in individual rights, the court has chosen to leave it to the legislature to enact a law allowing same-sex marriages. The court views the right to marriage as subject to statutory limitations, rather than a fundamental right. While there is no bar on transgender individuals entering into heterosexual marriages, the majority disfavors the position that same-sex couples have the right to adopt children. The court has directed the government to form a committee to decide the rights and entitlements of queer couples. However, the legalization of same-sex marriages by Parliament may be unlikely due to potential opposition on religious and cultural grounds. The LGBTQIA+ community still has a struggle ahead in their fight for equality.

### [Back in business: On the New Zealand election result](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/back-in-business-on-the-new-zealand-election-result/article67430639.ece)

New Zealand's recent national election results indicate that the country is likely to have a right-wing government led by the conservative National Party and its ally, ACT. The incumbent Labour Party, led by Prime Minister Chris Hipkins, experienced a significant decline in support, while the Green Party, a Labour ally, and ACT secured a notable percentage of the votes. This outcome is notable because the Labour Party, under the leadership of Jacinda Ardern, had previously won the national elections with a sweeping majority. Ardern, who was widely praised for her leadership during the COVID-19 crisis, stepped down earlier this year due to burnout and a loss of popularity. The opposition criticized Labour for failing to bring about the promised transformative change during its six years in power, and its strict COVID-19 measures contributed to economic challenges, including a recent recession and high inflation and interest rates. The new National Party leader, Christopher Luxon, campaigned on an economic platform and vowed to reduce interest rates and government spending. While major shifts in foreign policy are unlikely, Luxon will have to address issues such as the cost of living, homelessness, child poverty, and inequality while balancing pro-business policies with efforts to redistribute wealth.

The Congress party in Telangana has experienced a sudden rejuvenation after its victory in Karnataka, which has given it the confidence to become a contender in Telangana. The ruling Bharat Rashtra Samithi has been in power for nearly a decade and is facing anti-incumbency challenges. The Congress party aims to replicate its welfare guarantees model from Karnataka in Telangana, leading to an electoral battle driven by competitive populism. The BJP's limited support base in Telangana could be reflected if the Congress surpasses it. The outcome of the election will also indicate the mood of the electorate in southern states, where welfare and development politics take precedence over religious polarization. The success of the Congress in becoming a contender against the Bharat Rashtra Samithi will depend on the electoral campaigns and their impact on fence-sitters and undecided voters.

The ruling Congress party in Chhattisgarh is focusing on regional identity and welfare programs in its election campaign. The BJP, its main opponent, is targeting the government on corruption and unfulfilled promises. The Congress is emphasizing Chhattisgarhi sub-nationalism and its direct benefit transfer schemes to appeal to rural and tribal populations. Both parties are vying for the support of the Other Backward Classes (OBC) while the tribal population receives less attention. The BJP has accused the government of corruption and is trying to polarize voters by fielding candidates linked to communal riots. The contest is expected to be between the Congress and the BJP, but other parties like the Aam Aadmi Party and Bahujan Samaj Party are also participating.

India has expressed interest in hosting the 2036 Olympic Games as part of its global ambitions. The country sees the Olympics as a way to boost its sporting prowess following its success at the recent Asian Games. However, hosting the Olympics is a huge challenge due to the high costs involved. The IOC now requires potential hosts to present projects that align with their economic, social, and environmental realities. India's success will depend on how it manages these complexities.The article discusses India's ambition to host the 2036 Olympics and the potential benefits it could bring. The author highlights how hosting the Olympics can provide political legitimacy and contribute to a country's global ambitions. India's interest in hosting the Youth Olympics is seen as a signal to overcome previous negative experiences, such as the scandalous 2010 Delhi Commonwealth Games. The article also mentions India's desire for a permanent seat at the United Nations Security Council and its aspirations for a seat at the high table in a shifting world order. On the sporting side, India aims to build on its recent success at the Asian Games and believes it can win double-digit medals at the Paris 2024 Olympics. However, the article acknowledges the challenges of hosting a mega event like the Olympics, including prohibitive costs and the need to align with economic, social, and environmental realities.

The upcoming assembly elections in Mizoram, India's second least populated state, are expected to see a three-cornered battle. Mizoram's political contestation differs from other states, as it is less dependent on money and muscle power and more on social service and public standing. The ruling Mizo National Front (MNF) is facing competition from the Indian National Congress and the Zoram Peoples’ Movement (ZPM), which has presented a tough challenge. Chief Minister Zoramthanga has played the ethnic card to win support from the Mizo electorate by championing the cause of the Kuki-Zo people and ignoring a directive from the union government on biometric data collection. The ZPM has focused on the MNF's record on development and leveraged its strong performance in the Lunglei municipal council polls. Both the MNF and the ZPM have gained support, while the Congress and its alliance partners are strongest in rural areas. Inflation and concerns about development could influence voter choice. Mizoram, despite being a small state, is crucial for India's border security and has potential for economic growth in the services and tourism sectors. The multi-party contest is expected to raise awareness about development and ethnic solidarity issues.

### [Jaipur gamble: On the Rajasthan Assembly elections](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/jaipur-gamble-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-2023-rajasthan-assembly-elections/article67412814.ece)

The article discusses the upcoming assembly elections in the state of Rajasthan, where the incumbent Congress government led by Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot is striving to defy a historical trend of losing power. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), on the other hand, is hoping to return to power and bring about a change in leadership. Both parties are facing internal issues while competing for a majority in the state assembly. The Congress has managed to counter anti-incumbency sentiment through welfare schemes and effective public outreach, but individual members of the legislative assembly (MLAs) may face challenges. The BJP aims to distance itself from former Chief Minister Vasundhara Raje and has denied tickets to some of her confidantes, signaling a generational transition in leadership. The party still relies on the popularity of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The outcome in Rajasthan will influence the BJP's strategy for the 2024 Lok Sabha elections.

### [Vendetta without limit: On the resurrection of an old case against Arundhati Roy](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/vendetta-without-limit-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-resurrection-of-an-old-case-against-arundhati-roy-and-an-academician/article67412339.ece)

The author criticizes the revival of a 2010 criminal case against writer-activist Arundhati Roy and academician Sheikh Showkat Hussain, stating that it appears to be motivated by ill-intent. The case involves alleged divisive speeches and imputations against national unity made in New Delhi. The article suggests that the resurrection of this case follows a pattern of vendetta against civil society critics and highlights recent arrests under anti-terrorism laws. It also questions the timing of prosecuting political speeches from the past, considering the changes that have occurred in Kashmir since then. The article mentions that the Delhi police initially did not pursue sedition charges, but a metropolitan magistrate directed the filing of a first information report (FIR). The author argues that given the time elapsed and the current legal limitations, it is questionable whether the prosecution can proceed. However, the article notes that the lieutenant governor has approved prosecution for other offenses, excluding sedition. It remains uncertain if the police will press charges under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The article concludes by reminding readers to follow the community guidelines for posting comments and informs them of the migration to a new commenting platform.

The upcoming assembly election in Madhya Pradesh is expected to be a direct contest between the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress. The BJP, currently in power in the state, is hoping to overcome anti-incumbency by fielding new candidates and focusing on the personal image of Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The Congress, on the other hand, is trying to leverage the defections from the BJP to its advantage and is relying on former Chief Minister Kamal Nath to lead its campaign. The party is also attempting to appeal to caste politics and avoid communal polarisation. The Aam Aadmi Party may also pose a challenge to both parties in the election.

### [Spring cleaning: On GST regime reform](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/spring-cleaning-the-hindu-editorial-on-gst-regime-reform/article67408516.ece)

The Goods and Services Tax (GST) Council made several decisions to clarify tax treatment ambiguities, including reducing the GST on molasses from 28% to 5% to lower cattle feed costs and improve cash flows for sugar mills. The council also decided not to tax extra neutral alcohol (ENA) used for alcoholic liquor. This decision provides clarity on a long-standing issue and resolves varying positions taken by courts. The council has met frequently this year, and there are hopes that the GST appellate tribunals will become operational soon. The council plans to discuss "perspective planning" on the GST compensation cess and its replacement with a surcharge. However, the article points out that the GST regime needs holistic reform, including rationalization of the multiple-rate structure and the inclusion of excluded items such as electricity, petroleum, and alcohol.

Hmm, I am sorry, but I am only able to provide information and support related to Chatbase. If you have any questions or need assistance with Chatbase, feel free to ask!The upcoming state elections in Chhattisgarh, Mizoram, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, and Telangana should not be seen as a "semi-final" before the national Lok Sabha polls. These states have large populations and specific electoral concerns. The BJP and the Indian National Congress are the major players in three of these states, while regional parties have significance in Mizoram and Telangana. The BJP is capitalizing on the popularity of the central government and its Hindutva ideology, while the Congress promises a caste census and emphasizes its welfare measures. In Rajasthan, Chief Minister Ashok Gehlot remains popular, but his party faces challenges due to internal divisions. In Madhya Pradesh, Chief Minister Shivraj Chouhan faces anti-incumbency sentiment, but the state's fertile ground for Hindutva ideology keeps the BJP in the race. In Chhattisgarh, Chief Minister Bhupesh Baghel aims to showcase his government's welfare record and cater to regional identity, but the BJP poses a strong competition. The Congress hopes its recent rejuvenation and organizational strength will help it contest effectively in these three states and in the 2024 polls. In Telangana, the Congress expects to give a tough fight to the ruling party, with the BJP playing a spoiler role. The emergence of the Zoram People's Movement has altered the dynamics in Mizoram, creating a three-cornered fight. The stakes are high for the two national parties in these elections.

The National Conference (NC)-Congress alliance has won a decisive victory in the Ladakh Autonomous Hill Development Council-Kargil (LAHDC-K) election, defeating the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). This is the first statement made by the Kargil electorate since 2019 when Ladakh was granted Union Territory (UT) status. The BJP had hoped to expand its base in Kargil through various development initiatives, but the election results show that the final status of Ladakh and the need for special protections and constitutional recognition remain important to the local population.

The article discusses the recent surprise attack by Hamas on Israel, which resulted in the deaths of many people. It highlights the unsustainability of the situation in the occupied and blockaded Palestinian territories and the threats posed by non-state actors like Hamas to Israel. The violence in the West Bank has been ongoing, and the Israeli government has largely ignored it while pursuing other policies. The attack by Hamas has raised moral and pragmatic questions, as it indiscriminately targets Israeli civilians. However, the article acknowledges the underlying issues of the occupation and the lack of a peace process, which have contributed to the radicalization of Palestinians and the strengthening of Hamas. The author emphasizes the need to find a solution to the question of Palestine and addresses the geopolitical realignments in the region. The status quo cannot continue without consequences, and military operations alone would be insufficient for lasting peace and stability in the region.

India's performance at the Hangzhou Asian Games, where they won a record-breaking 107 medals, is being hailed as a watershed moment in the country's sporting history. The gold medals were mainly earned in track and field, shooting, and archery, but India also saw success in 22 different sports. This diverse range of achievements highlights India's increasing excellence and diversification in sports. Notably, cricket, which has traditionally been separate from multi-disciplinary events, contributed two gold medals to India's tally. However, it is important to consider the level of competition in certain sports, such as badminton and table tennis, which are highly competitive in Asia. While India has made great strides in sports, there is still work to be done to match global standards. The government and sports authorities have implemented initiatives to support athletes, but challenges such as inefficient administration, factionalism, court battles, and doping continue to pose obstacles. Overall, India's success at the Hangzhou Asian Games is a cause for celebration, but the nation must continue its efforts to bridge the gap with international standards.

### [NewsClick non-case: On the strange case of a terrorism FIR without a terrorist act](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/newsclick-non-case-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-strange-case-of-a-terrorism-fir-without-a-terrorist-act/article67397093.ece)

The Delhi Police have filed a First Information Report (FIR) against Prabir Purkayastha, the founder of Newsclick, and others, accusing them of various offenses without providing concrete evidence. The FIR invokes provisions of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) and penal provisions related to conspiracy and promoting enmity between groups. However, it does not mention any specific illegal activities or terrorist acts. The police are suggesting that foreign funds were illegally infused into India to cause disaffection against the government and disrupt the country's sovereignty and security. The FIR appears to link remittances by an American businessman associated with Newsclick to "Chinese" funds used for propaganda and undermining national security. This use of the UAPA allows for the criminalization of individuals based on "thought crimes." The FIR is seen as a tactic to prolong the detention of dissenters and send a chilling message to the media. There are concerns about the misuse of anti-terror laws by the current government and the invocation of national security to undermine individual and media rights. The case also raises questions about the creation of shell companies by telecom companies and whether a separate investigation into funding terror is warranted.

### [Tightrope walk: On RBI holding rates](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/tightrope-walk-the-hindu-editorial-on-rbi-holding-rates/article67397102.ece)

The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) decision to maintain interest rates unchanged, despite warning about the risks of high inflation, shows that they are in a difficult situation. Inflation has been accelerating, with significant increases in July and August. The MPC raised its inflation projection for the second quarter, but it may still be overly optimistic. The RBI hopes that recent reductions in LPG and vegetable prices will alleviate some of the inflationary pressures. However, the RBI's reluctance to raise interest rates further suggests concerns about the fragility of economic growth. There are also doubts about the accuracy of economic growth estimates and caution among forecasters about India's GDP outlook for the current fiscal year. Weakness in goods exports and an uneven monsoon are additional risks to GDP growth. The RBI must also be cautious about the weakening rupee and the potential importation of inflation.

The article discusses the ousting of Kevin McCarthy, the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and the implications for the Republican Party. McCarthy was removed from his position after a "motion to vacate" was invoked by Congressman Matt Gaetz. This exposed the Republican Party's divisions, particularly between McCarthy and members of the Republican Freedom Caucus who disagreed with his cooperation with Democrats on critical policy matters. The article suggests that this faction, known as the "GOP radicals," rejects compromise and aligns themselves closely with the political outlook of former President Donald Trump. This infighting within the party could have political consequences, especially with independent voters, in the upcoming 2024 election.

India's gross revenues from the Goods and Services Tax (GST) have increased by 11.1% to over ₹9.92 lakh crore in the first half of the financial year. Monthly revenues for 2023-24 are at ₹1,65,418 crore, with September's collections slightly below the average. However, with the festive season underway, collections above ₹1.6 lakh crore are expected to continue. While the government is confident in the fiscal context, there are concerns over the slowdown in GST inflows, which dropped to 10.2% in September. Growth from domestic transactions and services imports has also slowed. Authorities need to investigate potential revenue leakages from imports.

The article discusses the significance of Bihar conducting a caste survey and publishing a caste-wise count of its population. The survey reveals that 63% of Bihar's population belong to castes listed under the extremely backward classes (EBC) and other backward classes (OBC) categories. The article suggests that this may boost the political demand for a country-wide caste census and prompt a reconsideration of the legal ceiling on total reservation in education and government services. It may also impact party politics by influencing the BJP's attempts to consolidate all sections of Hindus and other parties relying on different sections of the OBCs. The article also mentions that the methodology used in Bihar's survey provides a precedent on how caste counts should be conducted, allowing for easier categorization. However, it emphasizes the larger goal of the constitution to achieve a casteless society and calls for ensuring equality of opportunity and equitable distribution of resources without further accentuating caste identity.

The 2023 Nobel Prize in Chemistry has been awarded to three scientists for their discovery and refinement of quantum dots. Quantum dots are small crystals with only a few thousand atoms that exhibit unique properties when densely packed together. The laws of quantum mechanics describe their behavior, allowing them to mimic the behavior of atoms. Quantum dots also have the ability to absorb and re-emit light at different frequencies depending on their size. These properties have found various applications in fields such as transistors, lasers, medical imaging, and quantum computing. The researchers recognized for their contributions are Alexei Ekimov, Louis Brus, and Moungi Bawendi. Although understanding the behavior of quantum dots requires specialized knowledge of quantum mechanics, their appeal lies in the beautiful colors they emit and the inspiration they provide.

The Bharatiya Janata Party-led government in India has been accused of targeting the news website NewsClick in a case that appears to be motivated by vendetta and harassment. The government has not provided any specific allegations for the arrest of the site's Editor-in-Chief and another person under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. The website is reportedly under investigation for a "terror case with Chinese links," but no evidence has been presented to support this claim. NewsClick has also not been given a copy of the First Information Report or informed about the charges against it. The website has been under scrutiny by the Enforcement Directorate and the Income-Tax Department since 2021, but no charge sheet has been filed. The actions against NewsClick seem to be driven by a desire to silence critical journalism. This targeting of journalists based on suspicion about funding undermines freedom of expression.

Anne L’Huillier, Pierre Agostini, and Ferenc Krausz have been awarded the 2023 physics Nobel Prize for their work in attosecond physics. They developed tools to study the rapid changes in the observable properties of electrons in matter. Dr. L’Huillier's team discovered that an infrared beam shone on a noble gas produced multiple overtones, and they explained this phenomenon using quantum mechanics. Dr. Agostini and his team demonstrated the production of light with a pulse duration of 250 attoseconds, while Dr. Krausz and his team isolated a single pulse of 650 attoseconds and used it to measure the kinetic energy of electrons. Attosecond physics has potential applications in various fields such as biochemistry, diagnostics, superconductivity, and manufacturing techniques. Although the immediate value of attosecond physics may not be apparent, it opens up possibilities for new discoveries and inventions.

This edition of the tournament will be hosted solely by India, with matches taking place in diverse venues such as Chennai and Dharamshala. The ODI format, often overshadowed by Tests and T20 leagues, gains renewed significance during the World Cup. Hosts have previously struggled to win the tournament, but recent editions have seen Australia and England overcome this jinx. India's team, despite a few injured players, looks strong with a focus on batting prowess and a formidable bowling attack. Other teams like England, Australia, South Africa, New Zealand, and Pakistan could also pose a challenge to India's plans.

Avinash Sable won the country's first athletics gold in the 3000m steeplechase, while Tajinderpal Singh Toor retained his shot put gold. There was also drama in the 100m hurdles as Jyothi Yarraji's bronze medal was upgraded to silver after another athlete was disqualified. Shooting and equestrian dressage were also successful, and the women's cricket team won the title. India's young stars have shown promise on the big stage, and various other sports have made valuable contributions.

Mohamed Muizzu, the mayor of Male and the choice of the previous ruling party, the PPM, has been chosen as the new leader of the Maldives. He won the presidential run-off with nearly 54% of the vote, defeating President Ibu Solih. Solih's loss is attributed to anti-incumbency sentiment, concerns over the post-COVID-19 economy, party rifts, and sovereignty issues. The run-off was seen as an India versus China contest, and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was among the first to congratulate Muizzu. The new leader will need to address economic challenges, maintain ties with India, and engage with China and the United States. It is important for both Delhi and Male to avoid viewing their interests as zero-sum games.

The article discusses a recent victory for a tribal community in Tamil Nadu, India, who faced state-led brutality 30 years ago. The community, called Vachathi, won a case at the Madras High Court on September 29, which is significant because it is the first time a community of adivasis (indigenous people) has defeated the state. In 1992, police, forest, and revenue officials accused the villagers of hoarding illegally felled sandalwood and subjected them to violence, including rape. The state initially refused to register a case against its officials, but the villagers sought a Central Bureau of Investigation inquiry, leading to a trial that lasted 15 years. Although the villagers won a conviction in 2011, it was later stayed by the Madras High Court. However, the recent judgment upholding the trial court's conviction signals a shift in Indian jurisprudence and reaffirms faith in the democratic process and the criminal justice system. The victory is seen as a significant moment in the fight for adivasi rights and highlights the power of an alert civil society, committed lawyers, an independent judiciary, and the resolve of victims seeking justice.

The hill areas in Manipur will continue to be under the Armed Forces (Special Powers) Act (AFSPA) for another six months, while the Imphal Valley will be excluded. This decision comes amidst violent ethnic conflict between the Meitei and Kuki communities. The Army had requested the re-imposition of AFSPA in the Valley districts to aid their operations against insurgent groups. The government's decision to exclude the valley districts from AFSPA has been criticized as partisan. The government claims that a detailed assessment of the ground situation is not possible at the moment, and that declaring an area as 'disturbed' may lead to public criticism and resistance. However, the fear of displeasing the majority Meitei community seems to be the core aspect of the government's policy. The situation is ripe for further conflict, and the Centre should take immediate steps to bring about reconciliation between the two communities.

India and Canada are engaged in a diplomatic dispute over the killing of a Canadian activist. India's External Affairs Minister warned against determining the response to terrorism based on political convenience, alluding to India's concerns over Khalistani extremism in Canada. Canada's UN Ambassador reiterated the allegations against India, highlighting the threat to democracies due to foreign interference. Both countries have expelled each other's diplomats and suspended visas and trade talks. Canada has yet to provide concrete evidence of its allegations, and India has denied them. The article suggests that Canada should take the first step in proving its allegations, and if evidence is shared, India should cooperate in the investigation. The grievances between India and Canada date back to the 1980s, but the recent actions have severely impacted trade, travel, and tourism ties.

The article also highlights significant inter-state variations in the elderly population and the need for a comprehensive approach to meet their needs, including physical and mental health, basic needs, income security, and social care. It mentions existing schemes for the elderly but acknowledges that many are unaware or find it difficult to access them. In conclusion, the article emphasizes the importance of providing a supportive environment for senior citizens to live in dignity.

This article discusses the recent crisis in the chamoli district of Uttarakhand, India, where the town of Joshimath experienced sinking and cracks in residential and commercial buildings. The land subsidence was attributed to tunnelling activities from the Tapovan Vishnugad power project. There were concerns about groundwater depletion and faulty construction practices. The Uttarakhand state disaster management authority commissioned eight institutions to study the phenomenon, but their findings were initially not made public. The article highlights the need for strict town planning and construction measures in the region to minimize risks and ensure public safety. It also emphasizes the importance of disseminating information on these risks and involving independent scientific counsel in policymaking.

Moody's Investors Service has raised concerns about India's digital identification program, Aadhaar, pointing out security and privacy risks associated with centralized digital ID systems. The report suggests that decentralized ID systems would provide users with more control over their data. Moody's also questions the reliability of Aadhaar's biometric-based authentication systems, especially for manual laborers in hot and humid climates. The government has made Aadhaar mandatory for various welfare benefits and essential services, leading to instances of exclusion for individuals without Aadhaar or difficulties in confirming their identity. The report calls for an honest review and course correction in the Aadhaar program before expanding its linkages.

### [Dramatic shift: On the AIADMK snapping ties with the BJP](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/dramatic-shift-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-aiadmk-snapping-ties-with-the-bjp/article67348114.ece)

The article discusses the decision of the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (AIADMK) to end its alliance with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and withdraw from the National Democratic Alliance (NDA). The AIADMK had previously supported the BJP on various occasions, but recent disagreements and a perception of subservience to the BJP have led to the decision to snap ties. However, the article also notes the possibility of reconciliation in the future. The AIADMK's decision could have electoral implications, potentially favoring the DMK-led front in Tamil Nadu. The article suggests that smaller parties may seek to align with the AIADMK or demand a larger share of power in the DMK-led coalition. The AIADMK's exit from the NDA is seen as a strategic move ahead of the 2024 elections.

### [War in Caucasus: On Azerbaijan’s recapture of Nagorno-Karabakh](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/war-in-caucasus-on-azerbaijans-recapture-of-nagorno-karabakh/article67344930.ece)

This article discusses the recent military recapture of Nagorno-Karabakh by Azerbaijan and the changing power dynamics in the Caucasus region. The conflict between Azerbaijan and Armenia dates back to the final days of the Soviet Union, when Nagorno-Karabakh's Armenian population held a referendum to break away from Azerbaijan. In 2020, Azerbaijan, backed by Turkey, fought against Armenia, supported by Russia, and captured much of Nagorno-Karabakh. The ceasefire brokered by Russia did not hold, and Azerbaijan attacked the separatists in Stepanakert, forcing them to hand over control to Baku. Two major factors that have contributed to Azerbaijan's success are Turkey's support and Russia's focus on Ukraine, which has weakened Russian power in the Caucasus. The article highlights the need for Azerbaijan to ensure equal rights and respect for the Armenian population in Nagorno-Karabakh to prevent prolonged resistance and potential unrest.

The article discusses the recent incidents in India's parliament that have tarnished its reputation, despite the new building being a symbol of unity and progress. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government introduced a bill to reserve 33% of seats for women in parliament and state assemblies, which received widespread support. However, during a discussion on the success of India's Chandrayaan mission, a member of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) made derogatory remarks towards a Muslim MP from the opposition. This incident was followed by the party's attempt to downplay and excuse the behavior. The Lok Sabha speaker and Rajya Sabha chairman are expected to take action against both the offending MP and visitors in the gallery who raised political slogans. The article emphasizes the importance of maintaining respectful dialogue between members and the need for punitive measures to prevent future incidents.

The Indian government has delayed the 2021 census due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and Home Minister Amit Shah recently announced that it will take place after the 2024 general election. The BJP government's decision to postpone the census has raised speculation about its intentions, particularly regarding the enumeration of caste. The next census will also be the first digital census, and citizens will be able to self-enumerate using their Aadhaar or mobile number. The census will involve the collection of details from over 1.4 billion people by government officials, and completion is expected to take at least 11 months. The government must address concerns and involve states and parties in the census process.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has released its first report on hypertension, revealing that globally, one in three individuals are affected by the condition, with four out of five not having it adequately controlled. Uncontrolled blood pressure is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as heart attacks and stroke. The report highlights that health risks associated with hypertension begin even below the clinical hypertension threshold, particularly in individuals who are diabetic, obese, and consume tobacco and alcohol. In India, 188 million adults aged 30-79 have hypertension, but only 37% have been diagnosed, 30% are treated, and a mere 15% have their condition under control. Excess salt consumption is responsible for 17%-30% of hypertension cases, and India is yet to implement measures to reduce salt intake. However, the country has made progress in improving blood pressure control through the India Hypertension Control Initiative (IHCI), which has enrolled 5.8 million hypertensive patients for treatment. The focus now is to increase the number of people on treatment and maintain blood pressure control.

The 19th Asian Games, delayed by a year due to COVID-19, have officially begun in Hangzhou. The event will feature nearly 12,500 athletes competing in 40 sports, including breakdancing and esports. Some sports, such as hockey, archery, tennis, and boxing, will also offer Olympic qualification spots for Paris 2024. China has historically dominated the medal table at the Asian Games, but India is hoping for a strong performance with over 650 athletes and high expectations for athletics, hockey, cricket, shooting, and badminton.

The Women's Reservation Bill has been passed by the Lok Sabha, aiming to reserve one-third of seats in the parliament and legislative assemblies for women. This move is seen as a significant step towards breaking the gender inequality in political representation. However, the implementation of the bill will be delayed due to its linkage to delimitation and census factors. This means that women will not have access to the 33% reservation in the 2024 general election. The bill also includes a provision for reserving one-third of seats for women from scheduled castes and scheduled tribes. The opposition is demanding an internal quota for women from other backward classes, but this should not be used as an excuse to delay implementation. Lessons can be learned from the successful representation of women in local bodies, where their participation is above 50% in many states. It is crucial to ensure that when the bill becomes an act, it is not just tokenism but a genuine effort to improve women's political representation. Women face numerous challenges in various areas, including health, education, and workforce participation. Therefore, providing better political representation for women is essential for growth and instituting change in key areas.

India emerged as the winners of the Asia Cup final against Sri Lanka, securing a 10-wicket victory in just 6.1 overs. Mohammed Siraj's impressive bowling performance helped dismiss Sri Lanka for a mere 50 runs. The victory marks India's eighth Asia Cup win and provides optimism as they prepare for the ICC World Cup. Despite earlier challenges, India appeared to be a strong and united team throughout the tournament. The campaign included a loss to Bangladesh, but India still held their ground against Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Afghanistan, Nepal, and Pakistan did not advance to the super four stage. While the organizers may have hoped for an India-Pakistan final, it did not materialize. Despite external factors, India remained focused on their game and secured the victory.

India's goods exports declined for the seventh consecutive time in August, while imports reached their highest level since March. The trade deficit widened to $24.2 billion, the largest since October 2022. Goods exports are down 11.9% so far this year, and imports have dropped 12.1%. Services exports are also expected to decrease in August, raising the possibility of wider current account deficits. Rising global commodity prices, particularly for oil and gems and jewelry, may further escalate the goods trade deficit. However, the uptick in engineering goods exports in August is a positive sign for India's economy.

The government has called for a five-day special session of parliament starting from September 18. The opposition parties have criticized the government for not consulting them before calling the session. The agenda for the opening day includes a bill to change the appointment process of the chief election commissioner and election commissioners, which the opposition plans to challenge. The government also proposes a debate on the 'parliamentary journey of 75 years,' which could be seen as a farewell to the current parliament building. The new building, which was inaugurated in May, has not been used during the previous session. The article argues that democracy is not about buildings and criticizes the government for evading parliamentary scrutiny and not involving the opposition. The government claims to be following protocol but has not engaged in dialogue with the opposition. The article mentions the changes to Article 370, which were introduced without notice or consultation in 2019.

The recent arrest of former Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu has led to the formation of an opposition alliance in the state. Telugu actor and politician Pawan Kalyan has announced his support for Naidu and the alliance, which challenges the ruling Yuvajana Sramika Rythu Congress Party's (YSRCP) strategy of isolating the Telugu Desam Party (TDP). The TDP had previously severed ties with the BJP in 2018 over the issue of special category status for Andhra Pradesh. Meanwhile, the YSRCP is facing criticism for its failure to attract industrial investments and its slow progress on the state's tri-capital formula. This has caused discontent among the urban middle class, while the party still maintains strong rural support. The possibility of an alliance between the YSRCP and the BJP for the 2024 elections is considered unlikely, given the YSRCP's main vote base among minorities, Dalits, and backward classes. The arrest of Naidu, who is facing corruption allegations, has made a return to the National Democratic Alliance (NDA) highly remote. This political development has also isolated the BJP, which was expected to ally with the Jana Sena Party (JSP). Overall, Naidu's legal troubles appear to have boosted his political prospects, while the YSRCP's efforts to marginalize the TDP seem to have limited options for the BJP.

This article highlights the ongoing ethnic strife in Manipur and the inability of civil society representatives to work towards peace. The Meira Paibi, an organization of Meitei women, has traditionally mobilized against armed forces and police excesses, alcoholism, drug addiction, and sexual violence. However, during the current conflict, they have been disrupting the operations of the Assam Rifles in an attempt to maintain peace. Buffer zones were created to prevent further violence between the two ethnic communities, but there have been attacks with armed forces unable to act due to disruptions caused by groups like the Meira Paibi. The looting of weapons by various groups has contributed to the intensity of the conflict. The article argues that the state government, its police, and the armed forces have struggled to maintain peace due to civil society groups supporting the violence. The presence of armed forces and the need for buffer zones have become essential in Manipur due to ethnic divisions. The hope is that civil society groups can rise above their narrow ethnic identities to seek justice and build solidarity networks for reconciliation and peace-building. However, the article suggests that there needs to be a credible alternative to the current leadership in the state for this to happen.

The Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR) has announced the winners of the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar (SSB) prizes, which were delayed by almost a year. The awards, considered to be India's equivalent of the Nobel Prize, are given annually to scientists under 45 who have made outstanding contributions in various fields of science. Last year, the government decided to reduce the number of awards given to scientists, which led to concerns about the discontinuation of the SSB prizes. However, the government ultimately decided to retain the awards. This year's winners consist of 12 men, mostly from centrally-funded institutions and Indian Institutes of Technology. The article suggests that instead of reducing the number of awards, there should be a case for expanding the recognition to include more women and researchers from state universities. The article emphasizes the importance of awards in encouraging and supporting scientists in their careers.

The Nipah virus has made a comeback in Kozhikode, Kerala, marking the fourth outbreak in the last five years. The virus is transmitted to humans from animals, with fruit bats being the closest reservoir. Two people have died from Nipah this week, with three others testing positive and being hospitalized. Treatment options for Nipah remain limited, with supportive care being the only available method. The government is taking measures to monitor and control the situation, including putting hundreds of people on the contact list of the deceased under medical observation. Preparatory steps are also being taken in neighboring states to prevent the spread of the virus. The article emphasizes the need for constant vigilance and a one health approach to prevent future outbreaks of zoonotic diseases like Nipah.

The latest Consumer Price Index (CPI) data from the NSO shows that while the pace of inflation has slightly decreased, food prices remain high. The CPI data reveals that the headline year-on-year inflation rate in August was 6.83%, with food prices still close to 10%. Urban consumers faced even higher food price inflation at 10.4%. While vegetable prices saw a month-on-month deflation, staple items like potatoes and onions continued to experience inflation. The government's imposition of a 40% export duty on onions has not had a significant impact on prices. Other factors, such as a deficit in monsoon rainfall and rising crude oil prices, further complicate the inflation outlook. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is faced with challenges in managing interest rates and achieving its inflation targets.

The Supreme Court has ruled that its 2014 verdict, which invalidated section 6A of the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, will have retrospective effect from 2003. Section 6A required central government approval for corruption investigations against officials of the rank of joint secretary and above. The court rejected arguments that those facing investigation should be given the protection of section 6A for offenses that occurred before the 2014 judgment. The judgment will only impact allegations from 2003 to 2014. The law now requires government approval for any probe into decisions or recommendations made by a public servant. The court has emphasized that post-constitution laws cannot be inconsistent with the constitution. While safeguards are necessary to filter out frivolous inquiries, anti-corruption provisions should not become a shield for the unscrupulous.

The Leaders' Summit of India's presidency of the G-20 grouping resulted in the unanimous adoption of the New Delhi Declaration, which is seen as a major success. The declaration achieved a détente between the "western" G-7-EU axis and the Russia-China combine over the issue of the Ukraine war. India's negotiating team took a more considered approach, achieving consensus on other issues before tackling the paragraphs on Ukraine. The declaration also made progress on cryptocurrency regulation and set a figure of nearly $10 trillion for climate change adaptation and mitigation projects for the Global South. Other initiatives included the admission of the African Union into the G-20 and the establishment of the Global Biofuel Alliance. India's attempt to hold the G-20 in multiple cities was noted as a unique initiative, but its viability for future G-20s remains to be seen. Overall, India's G-20 presidency aimed to "popularize" the organization and bring real change to the lives of the global population.

Despite facing stiff competition from Russia's Daniil Medvedev, Djokovic showcased his evolution and energy reserves. In the women's game, Coco Gauff secured her maiden slam triumph with a come-from-behind victory over Aryna Sabalenka. Gauff has made significant progress in her career, reaching the French Open final in 2022 and breaking into the top-10. Rohan Bopanna, partnering with Australia's Matthew Ebden, became the oldest man to reach a major final at the age of 43.

The G-20 summit in Delhi focused on the climate crisis and the need for clean energy and sustainable development. The United Nations' global stocktake report, released ahead of the summit, highlighted the challenges faced by major economies in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. Despite some progress, the world is still emitting gases that will exceed the limits agreed upon in the Paris Climate Agreement. The report calls for greater ambition and action from countries to reduce emissions and achieve net-zero CO2 emissions by 2050. It emphasizes the need for renewable energy sources and a shift away from fossil fuels. The G-20 leaders recognized the financial support required for developing countries and clean energy technologies. The report also emphasizes the importance of reversing deforestation and adopting electric vehicles. However, it does not provide a detailed breakdown of individual countries' efforts or shortcomings. The stocktake report will be crucial in guiding negotiations at the upcoming climate talks and fostering breakthroughs in addressing the climate crisis.

India's efforts to regulate dark patterns in e-commerce trade practices are a positive step. The government has sought public comments on draft guidelines to prevent and regulate dark patterns, which are deceptive tactics used by online platforms. Examples of dark patterns include auto check marks for travel insurance and mandatory email or phone number requirements that lead to unwanted messages. Governments around the world are increasingly recognizing the need to regulate this sector, with the European Data Protection Board and the US Federal Trade Commission issuing guidelines on dark patterns. The guidelines in India aim to identify and prevent false urgency, basket sneaking, confirm shaming, forced action, and subscription traps. This focus on consumer protection and privacy is crucial in ensuring a safe and fair digital environment.

The summit focused on strengthening food security and addressing global trade uncertainty. Modi emphasized the need for a rules-based post-COVID world order and positioned India as a reliable long-term strategic and economic partner for ASEAN members. India's trade ties with the region have grown but with imports surpassing exports, leading to a review of the free trade agreement. India seeks to stay engaged with ASEAN to hedge against the slowdown in Western markets and highlight its significance as an ally.

The recent bypolls in seven assembly segments across six states showed mixed political signals, with the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) winning three seats and opposition parties winning four. While there is no national pattern to be found in these elections, they do highlight local shifts. In one notable result, the BJP's Dara Singh Chauhan lost in Ghosi, Uttar Pradesh to the Samajwadi Party (SP) candidate, who was supported by the Congress, CPI(M), and CPI(ML)-Liberation. This loss is significant as Uttar Pradesh is crucial for the BJP's fortunes in the upcoming 2024 elections. The BJP also retained a seat in Uttarakhand but lost a seat in West Bengal to the Trinamool Congress (TMC). In Dhupguri, West Bengal, a combination of opposition parties faced off against the TMC, while in Puthuppally, Kerala, the CPI(M) and Congress fought against each other. The results of these bypolls were influenced by local factors and indicate the political landscape in these regions.

India is preparing to host the G-20 summit, which is seen as a more inclusive version of the G-7. The country is facing challenges such as the global economic downturn due to COVID-19, tensions with China, and the conflict in Ukraine. However, India has made efforts to prioritize issues affecting the developing world and has held meetings across the country to democratize the process. The success of India's presidency will depend on its ability to unite the fractious members of the G-20 and achieve consensus on global issues.

### [India that is Bharat: On a name game](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/india-that-is-bharat-the-hindu-editorial-on-a-name-game/article67277737.ece)

The article discusses the recent decision by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) government in India to use the term "Bharat" instead of "India" in official communication and documents. The article argues that this move, which suggests that "India" is a foreign imposition, has been weaponized for political purposes. It states that both "Bharat" and "India" are names that have cultural significance and historical roots in the nation-building journey of India. The article criticizes the opposition's reaction to this issue, stating that it unnecessarily turned it into a fundamental identity question. It suggests that both names should coexist and that imposing the use of one over the other undermines the nation's confidence and soft power. The article concludes by emphasizing the need for unity and bonding among the people of India, regardless of which name is used.

The Editors Guild of India (EGI) has faced police action and criticism from the Chief Minister of Manipur after releasing a report on media coverage of an ethnic conflict. The report claimed that there was one-sided coverage by journalists and also suggested that the state leadership was biased. The Supreme Court of India has provided interim protection to those named in the police case. The report also highlighted the negative impact of internet bans on journalism and the reliance on the state government for news. It called for reconciliation between the two communities involved in the conflict. The police case against the EGI is seen as a hinderance to civil society's fact-finding initiatives.

### [Time to decide: On the Himalayan region, its carrying capacity](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/time-to-decide-on-the-himalayan-region-its-carrying-capacity/article67273796.ece)

This article discusses the proposal to set up a 13-member technical committee to study the carrying capacity of the Himalayan region in the wake of the recent floods in North India. Carrying capacity refers to the quantity of a species that can thrive sustainably in a defined ecosystem. The article highlights the challenges of balancing rising population, infrastructural needs, and the precarious geography of hill-stations and Himalayan states. It mentions previous attempts to evaluate the impact of hydropower and road-widening projects in the region. The article argues that infrastructure development in the hills cannot be executed in the same way as in the plains, and suggests that either states must bear the higher cost of building more sustainably or designate certain regions as no-go zones. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of taking sustainable measures to minimize the risk to denizens.

The article discusses the recent trend of military coups in several African countries, including Niger and Gabon. It highlights the ease with which the military has seized power in these countries and the failure of Western ultimatums to restore democratic governance. The article also mentions the changing geopolitical dynamics in Africa, with former French colonies like Mali and Burkina Faso expanding Russian influence and Gabon replacing France with China as its main trading partner. The coups pose a threat to elections, regime stability, and order in the continent. Additionally, the article mentions the high levels of poverty and unemployment in Gabon, despite being one of the richest countries in Africa in terms of per-capita income.

The article discusses the proposal for simultaneous elections in India at all levels, including parliamentary, assembly, municipal, and panchayat elections. The article argues that this proposal goes against the idea of multi-tiered governance and is anti-federalist. It also questions the cost-saving benefits of simultaneous elections and raises concerns about the ability to hold representatives accountable. The article suggests that the Lok Sabha election should be separated from elections for assemblies due to varying campaign issues and democratic choices. The article concludes by stating that the idea of simultaneous elections is unworkable unless the term of each Lok Sabha and assembly is fixed and premature dissolution is restricted.

### [Opportune moment: On the uptick in GST revenues](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/opportune-moment-on-the-uptick-in-gst-revenues/article67270495.ece)

GST revenues in India have grown by 11.3% in the first five months of the fiscal year 2023-24, with an average monthly collection of ₹1.66 lakh crore. However, the growth rate has slowed down in July and August, reaching the slowest rise since July 2021. Revenues from goods imports have shown some recovery, while revenues from domestic transactions and services imports have grown at a slower pace. The festive season may fuel some growth, but high inflation could impact consumer spending. The mandatory e-invoicing for firms with a turnover over ₹5 crore is expected to have a positive impact on revenues. The overall trajectory of GST revenues is positive, and it provides an opportunity to simplify and rationalize the complex multiple rate GST structure. However, the rate rejig may have to wait due to inflation concerns. The government should continue the dialogue with states to revive the ministerial group tasked with recommending a new rate structure.

The third meeting of India - the Indian National Developmental, Inclusive Alliance resolved to contest the upcoming Lok Sabha election together. More than two dozen parties announced seat-sharing arrangements and formed five committees to improve coordination. Rahul Gandhi emerged as the center of unity efforts and plans to embark on a Bharat Jodo Yatra. However, it is important to note that these parties have local interests and the challenge lies in winning the confidence of the people. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) is a dynamic and flexible party, and being opposed to the BJP alone cannot define India's national alternative.

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has launched India's first space mission dedicated to studying the sun. The spacecraft, named Aditya-L1, will study the sun in multiple wavelengths with its suite of seven instruments. It will travel to the L1 Lagrange point, 1.5 million kilometers from Earth, where it will have an unobstructed view of the star. Aditya-L1's findings could inform future space missions and help solve mysteries about the sun, such as the coronal heating problem. ISRO has demonstrated its ability to handle complex navigational tasks in interplanetary missions and will bring these skills to Aditya-L1. Overall, this mission marks another milestone for the Indian space program and the national solar physics community.

The article discusses the disappointment surrounding the Indian government's inability to commit to a timeline for restoring statehood to Jammu and Kashmir. Four years after the state's status was downgraded to a union territory, the government can only say that the current status is temporary and steps are being taken to make Jammu and Kashmir a complete state again. The Supreme Court is currently hearing a challenge to the abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status, and when asked about a timeline for statehood restoration, the solicitor-general was unable to provide an exact timeframe. Despite claims of relative normality and improved security, there are concerns about the delay in holding elections. The government's development work since August 2019 is considered irrelevant to the constitutional challenge. The article emphasizes the need for early elections and the restoration of popular government in Jammu and Kashmir. The ongoing court proceedings are focused on constitutional and historical issues related to the alteration of the state's status and reorganization of its territory.

### [An uneven rebound: On the economy](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/an-uneven-rebound-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-economy/article67260410.ece)

India's economy grew by 7.8% in the first quarter of the year, slightly below the Reserve Bank of India's estimate of 8%. The central bank projects a decline in growth rate for the rest of the year, with a final quarter growth rate of 5.7%. Despite this, India remains the fastest growing major economy. However, global headwinds, including a slowdown in China, and domestic pressures such as inflation and a weak monsoon, could pose challenges in the coming months. The farm sector maintained its growth pace, but may taper off due to the monsoon's progress and low reservoir levels. The services sector saw robust growth, but employment levels remain below pre-COVID-19 levels. Private investment is still lagging, with government capital spending driving growth. Manufacturing saw a slight acceleration in growth, but a broader rebound in consumption demand is still awaited. Inflation, especially in food items, could dent demand from lower income segments. Interventions to counter inflation and relief measures ahead of the general election pose risks to fiscal math and growth.

India and China continue to struggle to repair their relations following a recent clash over China issuing a new map. The map showed disputed territories as Chinese territory, leading to protests from India, Malaysia, and the Philippines. While China defended the map as routine, it further complicated the territorial disputes in the region. The lack of trust between the two countries is evident, and prospects of a rapprochement remain dim. Rebuilding trust will require greater mutual sensitivity from both sides.India and China are still unable to repair their relations following a recent clash over a new map issued by China. This map depicted disputed territories as Chinese territory and drew protests from India, Malaysia, and the Philippines. The unnecessary issuing of the new map has only complicated the ongoing territorial disputes. In 2019, when India issued its own new map, China responded with strong statements and discussions at the United Nations Security Council. The prospects of a rapprochement between the two countries remain low, and rebuilding trust will require greater mutual sensitivity.

### [Neighbours and rivals: On the Asia Cup](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/neighbours-and-rivals-on-the-asia-cup/article67255735.ece)

The article discusses the Asia Cup cricket tournament, which was originally created to promote Asian solidarity in cricket. However, the tournament has often been affected by the political tensions between India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. The current edition of the tournament faced logistical challenges due to India's refusal to tour Pakistan, resulting in Sri Lanka stepping in as a co-host. The article highlights the disappointment that matches between India and Pakistan are reduced to guest appearances within ICC events and the Asia Cup. The teams participating in the tournament will see it as a preparatory stage for the upcoming World Cup. The Indian squad, in particular, is dealing with injuries to key players and is looking to find stability in their lineup. The article also mentions the resilience of Afghanistan's cricket team, despite the difficult situation in their home country. Bangladesh, who has yet to win the Asian title, will also be closely watched. The India-Pakistan match in the tournament is seen as significant in providing insights into the teams' performance in the upcoming World Cup.

This article discusses the dysfunctional functioning of the government and legislature in Manipur, a conflict-ridden state in India. The recent assembly session was adjourned just 48 minutes after it began, with only 11 minutes of business conducted and several legislators absent. The session was originally scheduled to convene on August 21, but the governor had not issued the notification summoning the house. This failure in conducting legislative functions reflects the breakdown of trust between legislators and the government's leadership. The article highlights the pressing issues in Manipur, such as rehabilitation of displaced residents, recovery of looted weapons, ethnic divide, economic blockades, and sporadic violence. It criticizes the government, which holds an electoral majority, for its inability to address these issues effectively. The article also mentions the previous controversies and defections in the Manipur assembly and emphasizes the importance of using constitutional means to resolve ethnic conflicts. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government's ham-handed approach and its failure to conduct proper legislative sessions are seen as contributing to the worsening situation in the state.

This article discusses the distress faced by the Cauvery basin due to a lack of rainfall during this year's southwest monsoon. Tamil Nadu has a significant shortfall of water and is seeking a daily release of water from Karnataka. Both states are facing difficulties in their agricultural sectors due to the water scarcity. The article emphasizes the need for a distress-sharing formula that is favored by both states. However, the implementation of such a formula has faced obstacles, as decisions by authorities and committees have been inconsistent. The article also highlights the importance of Karnataka complying with the directive to release water to Tamil Nadu, although the current quantum is insufficient. The overall aim is to prevent the Cauvery River from creating disharmony between the two states.

The article discusses the recent call by the Vishwa Hindu Parishad (VHP) and its affiliates to undertake a procession in the communally volatile Nuh district in Haryana, India. The authorities denied permission for the gathering due to concerns over law and order and the upcoming G-20 summit in the national capital. However, a few representatives of the Hindu outfits were allowed to offer prayers at three local temples under police escort. The security arrangements for this event were extensive, with a multi-layered security cordon and various precautionary measures taken. Similar measures could have prevented clashes that occurred during a similar procession on July 31, which resulted in six deaths. It is emphasized that Hindus and Muslims must put the recent past behind them and work towards restoring mutual trust and harmony. The article also stresses the need for the police and administration to deal firmly with any attempts to disrupt the peace and send a clear signal to fringe elements that no one is above the law. The article commends the Bharatiya Janata Party government in Haryana for its handling of the situation and emphasizes that communal conflicts can be controlled when the political executive shows determination.

Other outcomes included a framework to map global value chains, digitalization of trade documents, and a call to enhance micro, small, and medium enterprises' access to information. Prime Minister Narendra Modi emphasized the importance of empowering small businesses, which account for a significant portion of employment and GDP. India is also urged to support its small enterprises and streamline bureaucratic processes.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi visited Greece last week to strengthen bilateral relations between the two countries. Despite no Indian prime minister having visited Greece since 1983, the warmth and relations between the countries have not diminished. However, the lack of high-level contact has prevented the development of close strategic ties between India and Greece, unlike India's relationships with other nearby European countries. During Modi's visit, India and Greece agreed to establish a "strategic partnership" and announced plans for a dialogue mechanism between their national security advisers. They also discussed plans for a skilled migration and mobility partnership and cooperation on negotiations for the India-European Union free trade agreement. The focus of the visit was to forge a more comprehensive bilateral strategy rather than relying mainly on tourism, trade, and labor migration. Modi expressed hope that India's ambition to become a global manufacturing hub could align with Greece's aspiration to become an economic gateway to the EU. India and Greece also discussed the restoration of artifacts, which they may push for through UNESCO. Geopolitically, Modi's outreach to Greece coincides with Greece's efforts to diversify its options and strengthen ties with Israel and Cyprus. This coalition is seen as a counter to Turkey, which could also provide a common ground for India, given the tensions between Delhi and Ankara over Turkey's role in the Organization of Islamic Cooperation and the Kashmir issue. Both India and Greece face concerns over maritime security in accordance with international laws. Overall, the visit aimed to strengthen strategic ties and promote cooperation between the two countries.
