### [A torrid crisis: On heatwaves in northern India](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-torrid-crisis-on-heatwaves-in-northern-india/article68307796.ece)

Northern India is experiencing record-breaking heatwaves, with minimum temperatures exceeding 45°C in some states. Night temperatures are also abnormally high due to a lack of moisture and rain. The monsoon, which usually provides relief, has been delayed and is forecast to be below normal.

This extreme heat has led to a significant increase in power demand, with northern India importing power from neighboring regions to meet its needs. The prolonged heatwaves and high air conditioning use are straining the power grid, leading to blackouts.

Additionally, Delhi is facing a water crisis, with Haryana, a major source of water, refusing to increase supply due to its own challenges.

### [Caste away: On Justice K. Chandru Committee report](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/caste-away-on-justice-k-chandru-committee-report/article68307811.ece)

The Justice K. Chandru Committee recommends prohibiting students from wearing or displaying any caste identifiers to prevent caste-related violence in Tamil Nadu schools. These include wristbands, forehead marks, and caste-painted bicycles. The committee also suggests revising curricula to promote inclusivity and establishing a Social Justice Monitoring Committee to oversee these measures. However, the recommendation to eliminate noon meal kitchens in schools is rejected as it may exacerbate discrimination and deprive students of fresh, hot meals. Additionally, the suggestion to form a uniformed Social Justice Students Force is viewed with caution as it may replicate existing programs. The committee emphasizes the need to address caste discrimination at the grassroots level and to curtail the influence of caste vote banks in politics to achieve meaningful harmony among school students.

### [New dynamics: On the G-7, its identity, its purpose](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/new-dynamics-on-the-g-7-its-identity-its-purpose/article68304780.ece)

Italy's Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni hosted the "G-7 Outreach" Summit, welcoming leaders from 10 countries, including Prime Minister Narendra Modi, to discuss global issues. The summit aimed to move beyond the "West vs the Rest" narrative, focusing on the Global South and energy issues. The G-7 has been criticized for being ineffective in addressing global problems, with its meetings yielding little progress. The summit's joint communiqué highlighted the group's support for Ukraine, but lacked a clear plan to end the war. India, attending the summit for the eleventh time, focused on its elections and the importance of harnessing technology to bridge global inequalities. The G-7's purpose and identity have been questioned in light of the rapidly changing global power dynamic, with some suggesting it may be more effective to address global issues through a larger and more representative format like the G-20.

### [Drastic decline: On the BSP](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/drastic-decline-on-the-bsp/article68300601.ece)

The article discusses the contrasting fortunes of the Samajwadi Party-Congress alliance and the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) in the general election in Uttar Pradesh. The SP-Congress alliance won 43 seats and gained support from OBCs and Dalits by targeting the Union government on issues related to constitutional rights and economic problems. In contrast, the BSP's vote share fell to 9.4%, with even its loyal Jatav backers splitting their support between major political forces. The article suggests that the BSP can learn from the experiences of other parties that have taken to ideological and agitational struggle to represent the interests of Dalits.

### [Trade trapeze: On India’s exports](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/trade-trapeze-the-hindu-editorial-on-indias-exports/article68300569.ece)

India's merchandise exports experienced a decline of 3.1% in 2023-24, but recent trends indicate a reversal. The last two months have seen a rise in outbound shipments, with a 1.1% increase in April and a 9.1% uptick in May. Export growth has been observed in four of the last five months. The European Central Bank's decision to slash interest rates has boosted hopes of improving demand for Indian exports. However, rising prices of industrial commodities and food items temper these hopes. India's top 20 export items have outperformed last May's exports, with sectors like apparel, man-made yarn, and engineering goods recovering. Despite this, spice and shrimp exports declined due to quality and workplace concerns. India's trade deficit widened to $23.8 billion in May, primarily due to a record $13.2 billion deficit in petroleum products. Officials expect rising services exports and forex inflows to offset the deficit. However, the government needs to revitalize its schemes and efforts to boost goods exports with enhanced budgetary outlays.

The two-day "Summit on Peace" in Burgenstock, Switzerland, has concluded with mixed outcomes. The summit brought together over 90 countries, with 56 represented by leaders, and a joint communiqué signed by around 82 countries and organizations. The document calls for an end to the Russian-Ukrainian conflict and emphasizes sovereignty, territorial integrity, and international law. However, the event was marred by Switzerland's decision not to invite Russia and the failure to convince China to send a delegation. Additionally, no BRICS member signed the statement, and India, despite being a key player, did not endorse the outcome. India attended the conference but did not sign the communiqué due to its neutral stance on the conflict. The summit's outcome was seen as one-sided, and its impact was limited.

### [Criminalising words: on allegedly divisive speeches](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/criminalising-words-on-allegedly-divisive-speeches/article68297003.ece)

Delhi's Lieutenant Governor V.K. Saxena has given permission to prosecute writer Arundhati Roy and academic Sheikh Showkat Hussain for alleged "unlawful activity" in a case dating back to 2010. The case relates to speeches made at a conference in Delhi in 2010, which were deemed not seditious by the Delhi police at the time. The police did not prosecute the speakers, but a complaint was filed and a First Information Report was registered. The case was revived recently, with Saxena giving permission to prosecute under Section 13 of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA). Critics argue that the revival of the case is an example of the regime's crackdown on dissenters and outspoken critics, and that it is an attempt to criminalize free speech.

### [Food factor: On food inflation](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/food-factor-on-food-inflation/article68289807.ece)

India's provisional retail inflation rate may have eased to a 12-month low of 4.75%, but food price gains remained high. Food inflation remained unchanged at 8.69%, with vegetables and pulses being major contributors. Vegetable inflation continued to hover above 27% for a sixth consecutive month, with tomato, onion, and potato prices leading the charge. The outlook for vegetable inflation is not reassuring, with June's retail price trends and wholesale costs pointing to further pain for consumers. Food inflation also accelerated, with cereal prices and pulses prices increasing. The Indian Meteorological Department reported a 12% rainfall deficit since June 1, causing mild concern. Policymakers must address the issue of food inflation, particularly affecting poorer sections of society.

Mohan Charan Majhi, Odisha's first BJP Chief Minister, succeeds Naveen Patnaik after his 24-year tenure. A member of the Santali tribe, Majhi's appointment underscores BJP's outreach to tribal communities in central and east India. His political background as a former village sarpanch and legislator positions him to continue and build upon initiatives started by the previous administration. Despite Odisha's progress in poverty reduction and economic diversification, challenges remain, including high poverty rates. The BJP's focus should be on sustaining development efforts without returning to divisive politics.

The article discusses the composition of portfolios among newly appointed Ministers in India's 18th Lok Sabha, noting continuity in key roles held by the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Significant ministries such as Home and Telecommunications remain with the BJP, while smaller portfolios are distributed among coalition partners. It highlights Minister Jitendra Singh's broad responsibilities covering Space, Atomic Energy, Earth Sciences, Science & Technology, and Personnel. The article also critiques current challenges in research sectors, including funding delays, regulatory instability, and inadequate infrastructure, calling for enhanced ministerial focus to address these issues amid a coalition government's complexities.

The European Parliament elections in June 2024 resulted in a shocking loss for French President Emmanuel Macron's Renaissance party to the far-right National Rally party, causing Macron to call for fresh elections. The elections have also given a boost to far-right and ultra-nationalist parties in Germany, France, and Austria, while confirming support for Italy's far-right "Brothers of Italy" party. The Green parties have also been dealt a blow. The results have raised concerns about issues such as immigration, inflation, economic slowdowns, and environmental reforms, which could affect the international order, including India's relationship with the European Union. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will meet his European counterparts and the EU leadership during his visit to Italy's Apulia to attend the G-7 outreach, where they will discuss the European Parliament elections and the Indian elections that threw up an unexpected result.

In Odisha, after over 24 years in office, Chief Minister Naveen Patnaik of the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) is set to be succeeded by a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP)-led government. Despite the BJD's respectable vote share of 40.22% in the Assembly elections, the BJP secured more seats, winning 78 out of 147, compared to the BJD's 51. In the Lok Sabha elections, the BJD's vote share fell to 37.46%, while the BJP's rose to 45.41%. The BJP's campaign focused on Patnaik's health and his aide V.K. Pandian's background, which, along with defections and strategic political maneuvers, contributed to the BJP's victory. The BJD's previous cooperation with the BJP on various measures and its non-confrontational stance may have backfired, similar to other regional parties' experiences, leading to a loss of support and power. The article suggests that such political strategies can have long-term negative consequences for the parties involved.

### [​A new era: on the South Africa general election](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Ba-new-era-on-the-south-africa-general-election/article68254369.ece)

In the May 29 general election, South Africa's African National Congress (ANC) lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since the end of apartheid, with its vote share plummeting to 40.18% from 57% in 2019. The Democratic Alliance remained the main opposition with 21.81% of the votes, while the newly formed left-wing uMkhonto weSizwe (MK), led by former President Jacob Zuma, made a surprising entry with 14.58%. The Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) followed with 9.52%. This decline reflects the electorate's waning confidence in the ANC, which once enjoyed nearly 70% of the vote under Nelson Mandela's leadership.

President Cyril Ramaphosa, who took office in 2018, has faced criticism for failing to improve the economy, reduce the 32% unemployment rate, or address issues like water quality, power outages, and crime. With the ANC's legacy failing to sway voters, opposition parties are considering coalitions, though with conditions such as Ramaphosa's resignation and economic reforms. The ANC's challenge is to form a coalition that honors its anti-apartheid history while tackling South Africa's economic challenges.

### [People at the centre: On the Election results 2024](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/people-at-the-centre-on-the-2024-verdict/article68251276.ece)

The article discusses the results of India's 18th general election. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) did not achieve an absolute majority but, with its National Democratic Alliance (NDA) partners, secured a majority with over 290 seats. The BJP's tally was 240, a decrease from its previous count of 303. The JD(U) and TDP, NDA partners, won significant seats in Bihar and Andhra Pradesh, respectively, indicating a shift towards coalition politics.

The Congress party nearly doubled its seats from the last election, reaching 99, and solidified its position as a significant political force, though still behind the BJP. The article suggests that the Congress should maintain its pre-poll alliances and not form post-poll coalitions. Rahul Gandhi, the Congress leader, has emerged as a prominent challenger to Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

The BJP's strategy of communal polarisation was less effective this time, and the party is encouraged to be more constructive and respectful of India's diversity. The new government will face critical issues related to federalism and diversity, including the delimitation of Lok Sabha constituencies and the work of the 16th Finance Commission.

The article also addresses the reliability of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs), urging leaders not to propagate conspiracy theories and for the Election Commission of India to build public trust. The function of exit polls and their potential influence on stock markets is highlighted as a concern.

In conclusion, the election results reflect the democratic vitality of India, and the new government is tasked with meeting the diverse expectations of its people. The article underscores the importance of respecting India's federal structure and the role of regional parties in its democracy. Coalitions are seen not as a deficiency but as a strength in a pluralistic society. The people's verdict is clear in demanding a government that values diversity and federalism.

The article discusses the outcomes of the Assembly elections in Arunachal Pradesh and Sikkim. In Arunachal Pradesh, the BJP secured a decisive victory, winning 46 out of 60 seats, with Chief Minister Pema Khandu being credited for his stable governance and focus on welfare and infrastructure. The National People’s Party and the People’s Party of Arunachal also won seats, while the Congress was reduced to one seat. Concerns were raised about the lack of robust political contestation. In Sikkim, the SKM, led by Chief Minister Prem Singh Tamang, won 31 out of 32 seats, emphasizing regional identity and promises of Scheduled Tribe status for certain communities and job creation. Despite fighting against the BJP, the SKM considers it an ally, reflecting the trend of voters in the northeast favoring the ruling national party or its allies due to reliance on central government funds. The article suggests that the strong mandates in both states could influence the leaders' ability to negotiate benefits from the Union government.

The article discusses the commencement of the ICC Twenty20 World Cup in the USA, shortly after the IPL final. The tournament features 20 teams, including traditional cricket powerhouses and newcomers like Papua New Guinea and Uganda, aiming to promote cricket in a football-dominated world. The T20 World Cup, held biennially, is seen as a way to energize the T20 format, offering fast-paced cricket and national pride. India, led by Rohit Sharma, seeks to end its ICC trophy drought since 2013, amidst leadership transitions and team dynamics. India's campaign starts against Ireland, with a high-profile match against Pakistan in New York. The article highlights the importance of players like Travis Head and Jasprit Bumrah in a format where pace often overshadows nuance. The final is set for June 29 in Barbados.

The article discusses the impact of the 2024 general election campaign rhetoric on India's foreign policy. It highlights the trend of political parties revisiting settled bilateral agreements for domestic political gains, such as the Katchatheevu agreement with Sri Lanka and the Land Boundary Agreement with Bangladesh. The ruling party and opposition have made provocative statements about India's international relations, including claims of reclaiming Pakistan Occupied Kashmir and comments on the use of nuclear weapons. The article criticizes the use of foreign policy as a tool for political campaigning, noting that it could damage India's credibility and international relations. It calls for a return to bipartisan consensus on foreign policy, traditionally upheld in Parliament, rather than through divisive campaign propaganda.

The article discusses a recent baby smuggling racket uncovered by the Telangana police, highlighting the socio-economic factors driving such criminal activities. The racket involved an inter-State gang that trafficked babies from Delhi and Pune to be sold in Telangana and Andhra Pradesh, with up to 50 babies smuggled in the past year. The gang 'purchased' babies and sold them to childless couples for significant sums, with brokers earning substantial commissions. The article suggests that poverty and the long legal adoption process contribute to such crimes. It calls for government action to prevent future occurrences, including poverty alleviation, employment opportunities, awareness of adoption schemes, streamlined adoption processes, and effective policing. The article underscores that children are not commodities and should not be treated as such in the market.

Donald Trump has been convicted on all 34 charges related to payments made to Stormy Daniels in 2016, marking him as the first former U.S. President to become a convicted felon. The charges include falsifying business records and election fraud. Sentencing is set for July 11, and while imprisonment is possible, factors such as Trump's age and lack of prior convictions may lead to a lighter sentence like a fine or probation. Despite the conviction, Trump remains eligible to run for president, and his legal issues have seemingly unified the Republican Party behind him. However, polls indicate that a majority of swing state voters would not support him if convicted. The upcoming November election presents a critical juncture for American voters to determine Trump's fitness for office.

Agnikul Cosmos, an Indian startup, has successfully completed the maiden test flight of its 'Agnibaan' rocket on May 30, marking a significant milestone in the mission named 'Suborbital Tech Demonstrator' (SOrTeD). This achievement came after four previous attempts were aborted due to unfavorable launch conditions. 'Agnibaan', a 14-tonne, two-stage launch vehicle, is designed to carry small satellites into low-earth orbits and features 3D-printed components, including semi-cryogenic engines. The test utilized a scaled-down version of the rocket with a single engine. Agnikul's progress with 'Agnibaan' positions it to contribute to India's growing commercial launch capabilities, which are currently led by ISRO's PSLV and will soon include the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle.

The article also discusses the broader implications of private ventures like Agnikul and Skyroot Aerospace, whose 'Vikram' rocket launched in 2022. These companies benefit from the technical expertise and resources shared by ISRO, reducing development time and costs. They are also seen as potential catalysts for innovation within the space sector. The government's role in fostering knowledge exchange through supportive policies is emphasized. Additionally, advancements such as ISRO's development of carbon-carbon composite engine nozzles, which enhance payload capacity, illustrate the cross-sectoral benefits of research and education. The hope is that such innovations will have wide-ranging impacts, from aerospace to zoology.

The article discusses the intense heatwave in New Delhi, where temperatures soared to 52.9°C, possibly due to a faulty weather station thermistor. The government responded by fining those wasting water and deploying teams to monitor usage. The piece argues that blaming climate change solely for extreme heat is an oversimplification, as local factors also contribute. It criticizes New Delhi's inadequate heat response, suggesting that the city's action plan fails to address issues like water availability from Haryana and illegal connections. The article recommends long-term strategies, such as building reservoirs, tamper-resistant distribution systems, and year-round wastage checks. It also suggests architectural solutions for cooling, shaded walkways, and promoting air-conditioned public transport, emphasizing that governments must ensure people can cope with the heat responsibly.

### [Demonising protests: On the Umar Khalid case](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/demonising-protests-on-the-umar-khalid-case/article68231884.ece)

The article discusses the case of Umar Khalid, a former university scholar who has been imprisoned for over three years due to allegations of his involvement in the north-east Delhi riots of 2020. Despite arguments that the trial proceedings are excessively delayed and a previous judgment that could support his bail petition, the Sessions Court in Delhi has consistently denied bail, relying on earlier rulings and the Delhi High Court's 2022 verdict. This verdict supported the police's claim that the riots were planned, based primarily on WhatsApp chats about organizing road blockades.

The article highlights the broader issue of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) being used to deny bail by accepting the prosecution's claims at face value without detailed scrutiny of evidence. This has led to a pattern where dissenters are routinely denied bail, blurring the line between the right to protest and terrorist activity. The case of Umar Khalid is presented as both a reflection of this trend and an anomaly within the criminal justice system, which is criticized for its approach to personal liberty, protest demonization, and the handling of bail hearings.

The article discusses the critical issue of fire safety negligence in India, highlighted by two tragic fires in Rajkot and Delhi that resulted in over 30 deaths. Despite the National Building Code of India 2016 outlining fire safety protocols, enforcement is inconsistent due to it being a state subject. The National Disaster Management Authority's recommendation for significant funding to improve fire services contrasts sharply with the actual number of fire stations and servicemen, which falls far short of requirements. The article emphasizes the urgent need for India's leaders to address fire safety, especially in light of increasing heatwaves and extreme weather events, suggesting that a comprehensive approach involving the synchronization of the National Building Code and the Energy Conservation Building Code is necessary.

Former U.S. President Donald Trump is potentially facing a historic felony conviction related to 34 charges of hush-money payments to adult film actor Stormy Daniels. The charges, brought by the New York state U.S. District Attorney's office, allege that Trump paid Daniels $130,000 in 2016 to silence her about an affair they supposedly had in 2006. The prosecution claims that Trump falsified business records to conceal the payment, which they argue was an act of election interference. Trump's defense has attempted to discredit the testimony of his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, who claims Trump reimbursed him for the payout to Daniels.

If convicted, Trump could be sentenced to a maximum of four years per charge. However, factors such as his age (77), lack of prior convictions, and the non-violent nature of the crimes may influence sentencing. Despite the outcome of this case, Trump faces additional legal challenges, including allegations of election interference in 2020, involvement in the January 6 Capitol attack, and mishandling classified documents. These cases are currently in the appeals process and are unlikely to go to trial this year. The ongoing legal battles are expected to further polarize the political climate ahead of the November 5 presidential election.

### [Turnout conundrum: On stocktaking on voter participation](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/turnout-conundrum-on-stocktaking-on-voter-participation/article68225340.ece)

The article discusses the noticeable decrease in voter turnout in India's 2024 general elections compared to previous years. Despite regional variations, with eastern, northeastern, and southern states generally showing higher participation than western, central, and northern states, there has been an overall decline in voter turnout. Notably, Telangana and Karnataka saw slight increases in voter turnout. The article suggests several potential reasons for the reduced turnout, including a lack of competitive contests in certain states, inter-state migration, and extreme heat conditions. It raises concerns about the impact of voter apathy on democracy, emphasizing the importance of voting in shaping the government. The Election Commission of India is urged to investigate these trends further. The decline in voter participation is seen as a worrying sign for the democratic process.

### [The last lap: On the French Open](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/the-last-lap-on-the-french-open/article68225320.ece)

The article discusses significant changes at the 2024 French Open, particularly focusing on Rafael Nadal's unexpected first-round defeat to Alexander Zverev, marking only his fourth loss at the event in 116 matches. Nadal's future in tennis has been uncertain since a hip injury at the 2023 Australian Open, and despite nearing 38 and playing only 12 times this year, he continues to compete with enthusiasm. While he hasn't ruled out a return in 2025, his immediate focus is on the 2024 Paris Olympics. The article also notes a shift in the competitive landscape, with Novak Djokovic's form declining, Jannik Sinner and Carlos Alcaraz recovering from injuries, and Alexander Zverev facing a domestic abuse trial. Casper Ruud and women's favorite Iga Swiatek are highlighted as key contenders, with Aryna Sabalenka and Coco Gauff also mentioned. For India, Sumit Nagal's early exit is noted, but Rohan Bopanna and Yuki Bhambri continue in doubles. The article concludes with a nod to the changing guard at Roland-Garros and the anticipation of new champions emerging.

Payal Kapadia has made history as the first Indian filmmaker to win the Grand Prix at the Cannes Film Festival for her film "All We Imagine as Light." Her trilingual debut feature, an Indo-French collaboration, tells the story of two Malayali nurses in Mumbai and marks a significant achievement for independent cinema. Kapadia's film focuses on the friendship between three diverse women, emphasizing values of solidarity, inclusivity, and empathy. In her acceptance speech, she highlighted the collaborative nature of filmmaking and the vibrant Indian film-making ecosystem, particularly praising the Malayalam film industry. The article also notes other Indian successes at Cannes, including Anasuya Sengupta's Best Actress win, Karan Kandhari's selection for "Sister Midnight," and Chidananda S. Naik's short film award, among others. Kapadia, who previously won the best documentary prize at Cannes in 2021, hopes her Grand Prix win will inspire and support young independent filmmakers.

### [Maximum impact: On Indian Premier League and Sunday’s final](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/maximum-impact-the-hindu-editorial-on-indian-premier-league-and-sundays-final/article68222265.ece)

The Indian Premier League final was a decisive victory for Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) over Sunrisers Hyderabad (SRH), with KKR winning by eight wickets to secure their third IPL title. Both teams had a remarkable turnaround from their previous season's lower rankings, thanks to bold and aggressive cricket strategies. The introduction of the Impact Player rule played a significant role in the season's high scores. KKR's success was attributed to Shreyas Iyer's leadership, Sunil Narine's valuable player performance, and contributions from other key players. SRH's performance was bolstered by Pat Cummins' captaincy and innovative batting from their players.

The season also saw exceptional performances from other teams and players, with Virat Kohli achieving his second-best IPL run total. The Delhi Capitals and Royal Challengers Bengaluru made notable efforts to reach the playoffs, supported by standout performances from various players. The article also highlights the enduring skills of Dinesh Karthik and M.S. Dhoni. The absence of Indian stars in the latter part of the tournament due to T20 World Cup commitments was noted, but this rest period might benefit India's chances in the upcoming ICC event. The article concludes with optimism for the Indian team's prospects in ending their ICC trophy drought.

The article discusses the sixth phase of India's general election 2024, which saw 58 Lok Sabha seats across eight states and union territories go to polls. This marks the completion of voting in 486 constituencies in 28 states and UTs, including 105 Assembly constituencies in Odisha. The final phase is scheduled for June 1, with vote counting on June 4. West Bengal reported high voter turnout despite some violence, while Delhi saw lower participation, possibly affected by a heat wave. The Election Commission of India (ECI) published the total votes cast for the first time after the Supreme Court declined to order the release of Form 17C details. The ECI has been criticized for alleging a conspiracy to disrupt the electoral process and has been urged to address complaints transparently to uphold democracy and public trust in the electoral system.

### [Punishing Hamas: On Israel and the ICJ ruling](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/punishing-hamas-the-hindu-editorial-on-israel-and-the-icj-ruling/article68218262.ece)

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) has ruled that Israel must halt its military operations in Rafah, Gaza, to prevent the potential destruction of the Palestinian population there. This decision follows a genocide case filed by South Africa, where the ICJ had previously urged Israel to take preventive measures but stopped short of demanding a ceasefire. The court also ordered Israel to keep the Rafah-Egypt crossing open for aid, allow UN war crime investigations, and release all hostages. This ruling aligns with the International Criminal Court's Chief Prosecutor's claims that both Israeli and Hamas leaders have committed war crimes. Despite these international legal pressures and the issuance of arrest warrants for Israeli leaders, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel continued its military actions in Rafah.

The ongoing conflict, which began over seven months ago after a Hamas attack, has seen heavy casualties and widespread condemnation of Israel's military tactics, which have been deemed disproportionate. The conflict has not only failed to meet Israel's objectives but has also led to international isolation and growing support for Palestine, evidenced by Norway, Ireland, and Spain's recognition of the State of Palestine. The war's continuation and the ICJ's ruling reflect the increasing challenges Israel faces in maintaining its security and international standing.

### [Welcome bounty: On the RBI’s ₹2.11-lakh-crore transfer to the Union government](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/welcome-bounty-on-the-rbis-transfer-to-the-union-government/article68212198.ece)

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has decided to transfer a record surplus of nearly ₹2.11 lakh crore to the Union government for the fiscal year 2023-24. This amount is significantly higher than the previous year's transfer and exceeds the interim budget expectations. This move is expected to provide the upcoming government, which will be formed after the general elections on June 4, with additional financial flexibility for the budget in July. The increase in surplus is attributed to the RBI's effective asset management, including gains from overseas securities and foreign exchange interventions. Additionally, the RBI has increased its Contingent Risk Buffer provisioning by 50 basis points to 6.5% to safeguard against economic risks. This surplus transfer is seen as a boost for the government to increase capital spending and maintain fiscal stability, reflecting the RBI's confidence in the strength of the Indian economy.

### [Southern sojourn: On the 46th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting in India](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/southern-sojourn-on-46th-antarctic-treaty-consultative-meeting-in-india/article68211556.ece)

The 46th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting (ATCM) has gathered delegates from over 60 countries in Kochi, Kerala. The meeting, which includes 29 voting members and other observers, is addressing various issues, including a proposal backed by India and other countries to regulate tourism in Antarctica. The proposal is significant due to the continent's lack of an indigenous population and its appeal as a remote, untouched wilderness. Tourism in Antarctica has surged from 8,000 visitors in 1993 to 105,000 in 2022, not counting scientists and research personnel. This increase has raised concerns about pollution and the impact on the region's unique biodiversity. The ATCM discussions also touch on the long-term implications of increased human presence and the potential influence on territorial claims, despite the treaty's current prohibition. India, while supporting the regulatory proposal, must consider the future prospects of tourism and its potential impact.

### [Powerful symbolic value: On the recognition of Palestine](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/powerful-symbolic-value-on-the-recognition-of-palestine/article68208336.ece)

The article discusses significant international developments regarding the Israel-Palestine conflict. Ireland, Norway, and Spain have announced their intention to formally recognize the state of Palestine, joining eight EU members who have already done so. This move reflects a shift in global opinion, as evidenced by a UN General Assembly resolution supported by 143 countries, including India, calling for Palestinian state recognition.

The International Criminal Court has sought arrest warrants for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Defence Minister Yoav Gallant, as well as Hamas leaders, for alleged war crimes. Additionally, the International Court of Justice is set to deliver a verdict on a petition by South Africa regarding Israel's actions in Gaza.

These developments are seen as symbolic and politically significant, aimed at supporting moderate forces and pushing Israel to reconsider its actions in Rafah to prevent civilian casualties and allow humanitarian aid into Gaza. The article suggests that the international community's stance is a reminder to Netanyahu that despite his disengagement from the two-state solution, it remains the preferred path to peace. Netanyahu's apparent indifference to these messages is portrayed as isolating him further from an international community that initially sympathized with Israel but has since been appalled by its military campaign.

### [Snap poll: On the surprise election announcement for the U.K.](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/snap-poll-on-the-surprise-election-announcement-for-the-uk/article68208273.ece)

Prime Minister Rishi Sunak has announced an unexpected election for the United Kingdom set for July 4, ahead of the mandatory election date of January 2025. This decision comes amidst consistent polls indicating a potential significant loss for the Conservative Party in the next election. Factors that may have influenced this early election include the U.K.'s inflation rate dropping to 2.3%, the lowest in three years, a positive review of Sunak's handling of the economy post-COVID-19, and a legal victory regarding immigration reforms involving the processing of some asylum seekers' applications in Rwanda.

Despite these developments, there is evident voter discontent after 14 years of Conservative rule. Sunak has highlighted the current global security risks, citing the ongoing Russian-Ukraine conflict, tensions in West Asia, and the economic implications of these issues. However, the government's efforts to manage small boat crossings have seen mixed results, with a significant increase in 2024 despite a previous decrease. Sunak's remarks suggest a challenge to the Labour Party's confidence in the upcoming election, questioning the basis of their optimism.

### [Setting the bar: On the Election Commission of India](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/setting-the-bar-on-the-election-commission-of-india/article68204217.ece)

The article discusses the Election Commission of India's (ECI) recent actions to maintain impartiality and prevent divisive campaigning in the general elections. The ECI has been criticized for its ineffectiveness and partiality, which is partly due to the partisan method of appointing its members. The ECI has issued warnings to both the BJP and Congress leaders to avoid statements that could divide society or create caste and community tensions. This includes a response to a complaint about Prime Minister Narendra Modi's speech and a censure of a BJP candidate for remarks against Mamata Banerjee. The ECI has also taken action against various political leaders for violating the model code of conduct, with some complaints still pending. The article argues that while these actions may seem to show impartiality, they do not address the deeper issue of distinguishing between legitimate political debate and xenophobic incitement. The ECI's integrity and credibility are crucial for the legitimacy of elections, and its independence should be reinforced by all stakeholders in Indian democracy. Reinforcing the ECI's independence is emphasized as a priority for maintaining the legitimacy of elections.

### [Justified balance: On the ICC move against Israel, Hamas](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/justified-balance-on-the-icc-move-against-israel-hamas/article68203911.ece)

The International Criminal Court (ICC) has initiated steps towards accountability for war crimes committed since October 7, 2023, by seeking arrest warrants against leaders from both Hamas and Israel. This action follows a series of deadly attacks by Hamas that resulted in over 1,200 Israeli deaths and the taking of hostages, and a subsequent heavy military retaliation by Israel in Gaza, causing over 35,000 deaths, predominantly among women and children. The ICC's move has sparked debate over the moral equivalence of charging a democratic nation's leaders and an armed group with war crimes and crimes against humanity. While Israel defends its actions as legitimate self-defense, the ICC's decision could have significant diplomatic repercussions, potentially isolating Israel and affecting its stance on the Palestinian issue. Despite Israel and the U.S. not being ICC members, the precedent set by cases like that of Russian President Vladimir Putin suggests that this may not prevent the issuance of warrants. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is expected to leverage this development politically within Israel.

### [Vote for a change: On the voter in Kashmir](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/vote-for-a-change-on-the-voter-in-kashmir/article68200791.ece)

The article discusses the voter turnout in the recent general elections in the Kashmir Valley, specifically in the Srinagar and Baramulla constituencies. Voter participation in these areas was below the national average but showed a significant increase from previous years. The article suggests that this increase may indicate a desire for change among the electorate, who have faced political constraints and lack of legislative representation since the dissolution of the elected Assembly and the bifurcation of Jammu and Kashmir into two Union Territories. The abrogation of Article 370 and subsequent political developments have also been a point of contention. The article critiques Union Home Minister Amit Shah's interpretation of the higher turnout as an endorsement of these political changes, arguing that the increased voter participation is more likely a call for addressing local concerns and political representation. The piece concludes by urging the Indian state to listen to the voices of the Valley and make necessary amends.

### [End the punishment: on Julian Assange](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/end-the-punishment-on-julian-assange/article68200508.ece)

Julian Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, has been granted the right to appeal against his extradition to the U.S. in the U.K. courts. The appeal is based on assurances from the U.S. that he would be treated fairly and not face the death penalty. The case has garnered significant attention since WikiLeaks' 2010 release of classified U.S. military footage and documents, which raised questions about human rights violations. Assange has already spent a considerable amount of time in confinement, first in the Ecuadorian Embassy and then in Belmarsh Prison. Critics argue that his actions put lives at risk, but supporters claim he has performed a journalistic service by exposing wrongdoing. The court's decision allows Assange some time to prepare his appeal.

The article discusses the fifth phase of the 2024 general elections in India, which saw contests in 49 seats, including key constituencies in Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra, West Bengal, and Odisha. It highlights the significant battles in urban Maharashtra, where the fragmentation of regional parties has intensified the political struggle. Voter turnout in Maharashtra was low, particularly in Mumbai. The performance of the Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena faction in its strongholds could influence future electoral outcomes.

In Uttar Pradesh, the opposition has sustained a competitive race by focusing on livelihood issues, challenging the BJP's campaign centered around the Ram Mandir consecration. Similarly, in Bihar, the Rashtriya Janata Dal's emphasis on employment has heightened the electoral contest. Overall voter turnout was slightly lower than in 2019, with women voters playing a pivotal role in West Bengal and Odisha. The Trinamool Congress (TMC) and the Biju Janata Dal (BJD) are relying on their welfare measures and mobilization of women through self-help groups to secure support.

### [Death of a President: On Iran’s Ebrahim Raisi](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/death-of-a-president-the-hindu-editorial-on-irans-ebrahim-raisi/article68196673.ece)

The article reports the tragic death of Iran's President Ebrahim Raisi and Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian in a helicopter crash in Iran's East Azerbaijan province. The incident occurred while they were traveling to Tabriz after a joint event with Azerbaijan's President. President Raisi, who came to power in 2021, was known for his conservative stance and close ties with Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. His administration focused on strengthening Iran's relationships with Russia and China, supporting militias like Hamas and Hezbollah, and expanding the nuclear program.

Raisi's death comes at a critical time for Iran, which is grappling with economic challenges and social unrest, partly due to U.S. sanctions. The nuclear deal remains inactive, and regional tensions are high, especially after a recent Iranian attack on Israel. The loss of Raisi and Amir-Abdollahian, both key figures in Iran's government, creates a vacuum in leadership during a period of domestic and geopolitical instability. Iran must now investigate the crash, manage the transition of power smoothly, and prepare for a presidential election within 50 days. The article suggests that while the presidency may change hands, Iran's foreign policy is likely to remain consistent. However, the sudden loss of experienced leaders adds complexity to the nation's challenges.

The article discusses the arrest of **Bibhav Kumar**, a personal aide to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, following allegations of assault made by **AAP Rajya Sabha member Swati Maliwal**. Despite initial statements from AAP leader Sanjay Singh indicating that strict action would be taken, the AAP did not act against Kumar, leading to Maliwal filing a police complaint. The AAP has since accused Maliwal of being a pawn of the BJP, which has entered the fray along with the Congress, reminding Kejriwal of his advocacy for laws supporting women's statements in assault cases. The article calls for an unbiased investigation, criticizes the BJP's hypocritical stance given its muted response to allegations against its ally's MP, and urges Kejriwal to break his silence. It highlights the AAP's need for introspection, given its isolation from public scrutiny and lack of organizational decision-making structures, despite its rise as a response to political decadence in India.

Two years following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, Switzerland is organizing a peace conference in Bürgenstock on June 15-16, aiming to include countries outside the Western coalition. India, a significant partner of Russia and a leader in the Global South, is a priority invitee, as indicated by recent high-level visits from Swiss and Ukrainian officials. While 50 countries, mainly from the EU, NATO, G-7, and allies like Japan, South Korea, and Australia, have confirmed attendance, Russia is not invited. The focus is on 'BICS' nations (BRICS minus Russia) to potentially influence future discussions with Moscow. However, Brazil and South Africa will not attend, leaving the participation of China and India, pending Prime Minister Modi's re-election, in question.

The conference aims to create a peace framework, addressing food security, navigation freedom, nuclear safety, and humanitarian issues. Success seems challenging without both conflict parties present and as long as military gains are pursued. The UN has failed to pressure Russia through resolutions, and India's non-critical stance towards Russia suggests it may wait for a more balanced peace initiative before fully committing.

The article discusses the state of the electoral campaigns in India after the fourth phase of the general election, highlighting the disconnect between the electorate's concerns and the campaign rhetoric. It notes that while voters emphasize job creation, inflation, and development, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the BJP focus on attacking the opposition rather than addressing these issues. The article criticizes Modi's use of divisive rhetoric and half-truths, particularly against southern parties, which is seen as problematic given the economic integration between the north and south. It also mentions the BJP's controversial induction of Manish Kashyap, who was jailed for spreading false news. The article suggests that Modi should concentrate on socio-economic differences between the BJP and the INDIA bloc rather than fostering divisive politics.

India has solidified its trade and infrastructure relationship with Iran by signing a **10-year agreement** to develop and operate the **Chabahar port**, despite the ongoing tensions in West Asia. This move involves an Indian investment of **$120 million** and a credit line of **$250 million** for the port's development. The U.S. has warned that such business deals with Iran could lead to sanctions, reflecting past instances where American sanctions delayed the project. The Chabahar port is strategically important for India as it provides an alternative trade route to Afghanistan and Central Asia, bypassing Pakistan. It is also expected to link to the **International North-South Transport Corridor (NSTC)**, which would enhance trade with Europe via Iran, Azerbaijan, and Russia, and serve as a counterbalance to China's influence in the region through its Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Despite the U.S.'s changing stance towards Iran and the region, the article suggests that India should remain committed to the Chabahar project to bolster its trade and connectivity with Central Asia, which is crucial for its ascent on the global stage.

The Supreme Court of India has invalidated the arrest and remand of NewsClick founder Prabir Purkayastha, citing the Delhi police's failure to provide written grounds for his arrest. The Court criticized the police for their secretive approach and for trying to bypass due process. The case against Purkayastha, which involved accusations under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, was deemed to lack any concrete unlawful act or evidence of terrorism.

The Court's judgment also emphasized the necessity of providing written grounds for arrest, extending this requirement from the Prevention of Money Laundering Act to the UAPA and other offenses. The charge sheet filed by the police contained controversial claims, including allegations of Purkayastha being funded by the Chinese government and conspiring to undermine Indian democracy, which the Court found to be exaggerated and not a basis to deny bail. The adherence to procedural norms in providing arrest grounds was upheld as paramount by the Court.

### [Trade imbalance: on India’s merchandise exports](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/trade-imbalance-on-indias-merchandise-exports/article68183110.ece)

India's merchandise exports saw a slight increase of 1.07% in April 2024, reaching $34.99 billion, despite a 3% contraction in the previous fiscal year due to global trade disruptions. The growth was primarily driven by pharmaceuticals, chemicals, electronics, and petroleum products. However, 17 out of the top 30 export items experienced a decline. Concurrently, imports surged by 10.25% to over $54 billion, driven by high oil and gold prices, leading to a trade deficit of $19.1 billion, the highest in four months.

The World Trade Organization anticipates a 2.6% rise in global trade volumes in 2024. India aims to capitalize on this by addressing challenges in labour-intensive sectors like garments and footwear, where it faces competition from Bangladesh and Vietnam. Quality concerns in spices, drugs, and environmental issues in shrimp exports also need attention. With favourable monsoon predictions, the government must act swiftly to boost agricultural exports and manage the trade balance effectively.

### [Crime and time: On election-time incarceration](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/crime-and-time-on-election-time-incarceration/article68179125.ece)

The article discusses the judicial inconsistencies in the application of interim bail for political figures in India. It highlights the case of Hemant Soren, former Chief Minister of Jharkhand and leader of the Jharkhand Mukti Morcha, who was arrested and is seeking interim bail to campaign for the general election. The Supreme Court previously granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, emphasizing the importance of electoral democracy. However, the Court has postponed Soren's hearing, requiring the Enforcement Directorate's input first.

The delay in Soren's case is attributed to the Jharkhand High Court's two-month wait before dismissing his plea. The article contrasts the charges against Kejriwal and Soren, noting the reliance on different types of evidence in their respective cases. It also comments on the complexities introduced by the Prevention of Money Laundering Act's stringent bail provisions, which require courts to assess the overall merits of a case at the bail stage. The article concludes by reflecting on the political sensitivity of bail decisions during elections and their impact on democratic fairness.

In a significant move, Russian President Vladimir Putin, after being inaugurated for his fifth term, dismissed his long-serving Defence Minister, Sergei Shoigu, and appointed Andrei Belousov, an economist, to lead the Defence Ministry. This shift underscores the economic dimension of the war in Ukraine, as Russia grapples with maintaining its wartime economy and defence production amid severe Western sanctions. Despite Shoigu's past successes, including the annexation of Crimea and military operations in Syria, his strategy in Ukraine has faced criticism. The appointment of Belousov, a technocrat, aims to swiftly achieve military objectives in Ukraine.

Russia has recently intensified its military efforts, launching an offensive towards Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city. The outcome remains uncertain as Ukraine anticipates additional arms from the U.S. The conflict has strained Russia's relations with the West, particularly Europe, and pushed the country closer to China. Domestically, Putin has consolidated power and suppressed dissent. While the Russian government has so far shielded its citizens from the impact of sanctions, the sustainability of this protection is questionable if the conflict drags on. Ukraine has retaliated by targeting Russia's Black Sea fleet and border regions. Despite the challenges, Putin believes he has the upper hand. However, further advances in Ukraine would leave him presiding over a more oppressive, economically fragile Russia, isolated from the West and engaged in a costly war with a resilient adversary.

The article discusses India's retail inflation data for April, which showed a slight decrease in the Consumer Price Index (CPI) to 4.83%, marking an 11-month low. Despite this, there was a concerning increase in food prices, with the Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) rising to 8.7%. Rural areas experienced higher inflation rates than urban areas, particularly in food prices, which is troubling given the essential nature of food expenditures. Cereals, a significant component of the food category, saw a rise in inflation, with rice and wheat prices increasing notably compared to the previous year. Vegetable inflation remained in double digits due to high temperatures, and pulses also continued to see significant price increases. The article highlights the dependence on a 'normal monsoon' to stabilize prices, as water storage levels are low, affecting the agricultural sector and overall price stability. The summary omits any unrelated content or advertisements.

### [Lame excuses: On Manipur and the ethnic conflict](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/lame-excuses-on-manipur-and-the-ethnic-conflict/article68174995.ece)

The article discusses the ongoing crisis in Myanmar and its impact on neighbouring India, particularly the states of Mizoram and Manipur. It has been over three years since the military coup in Myanmar, which led to widespread repression and violence, especially against ethnic minorities. As a result, many have fled to India seeking refuge. In Mizoram, the Chin refugees are welcomed as ethnic kin, while in Manipur, they face stigmatization and are conflated with issues of cross-border drug trade. The Manipur government's actions, such as ending the Free Movement Regime and plans to fence the India-Myanmar border, are seen as majoritarian and have exacerbated ethnic tensions. The Chief Minister of Manipur attributes the conflict to actions against poppy cultivation and illegal immigration, but this oversimplifies the complex ethnic strife in the state. The article suggests that the government's inability to build trust among the Kuki-Zo community and the militarization of society have worsened the situation. It concludes that without a change in leadership and approach, the conflict in Manipur is likely to persist.

### [Towards the endgame: on the fourth phase of the general election](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/towards-the-endgame-on-the-fourth-phase-of-the-general-election/article68171430.ece)

In the fourth phase of India's 2024 Lok Sabha elections, 96 constituencies across 23 states and union territories cast their votes, bringing the total to 379 constituencies that have voted so far. This phase included all seats in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana, as well as part of the Assembly elections in Andhra Pradesh and Odisha. The BJP, which won 42 of these seats in 2019, faces competition from regional parties like the YSRCP and BJD. The election campaign lacks a unifying theme, with parties trying various slogans to attract voters.

The Election Commission of India (ECI) clashed with the Congress over the delay in releasing voter turnout data, with the ECI criticizing the skepticism as contemptuous. The BJP and Congress have focused their voter mobilization on religious and caste identities. Controversies arose from demographic presentations by a government adviser and racist language used by a Congress adviser. Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, after being granted interim bail, has re-entered the campaign, challenging the BJP on the future of Narendra Modi's prime ministership and positioning himself as a central figure in the opposition with his list of welfare guarantees. This has intensified the dynamic tensions within the ideologically diverse opposition forces.

### [Murder and motive: on the Narendra Dabholkar murder case](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/murder-and-motive-on-the-narendra-dabholkar-murder-case/article68171408.ece)

The article discusses the sentencing of two men to life imprisonment for the murder of Narendra Dabholkar, a rationalist and anti-superstition activist, in Pune, India. The court's decision comes over a decade after the assassination in August 2013. The Central Bureau of Investigation's failure to prove the conspiracy behind the killing resulted in the acquittal of the main conspirator, linked to the right-wing organization Sanatan Sanstha. The organization is also suspected in other ideologically motivated murders between 2013 and 2017. The judgment emphasizes the need for direct evidence to prove a conspiracy, despite the motive being clear. The article calls for the governments of Maharashtra and Karnataka to demonstrate political will in protecting independent thinkers and activists by expediting trials and establishing the full extent of the conspiracy motivated by religious extremism.

### [Modest rebound: On IIP data](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/modest-rebound-on-iip-data/article68168358.ece)

India's industrial output growth decelerated to **4.9% in March**, down from February's **5.6%**. This slowdown occurred despite a favorable comparison to the previous year when the Index of Industrial Production (IIP) had decreased by **1.9%**. Mining output growth fell to a **19-month low of 1.2%**, while manufacturing output slightly improved to **5.2%**, and electricity generation increased by **8.6%**. The National Statistical Office will soon update the GDP growth estimates for 2023-24, which are expected to include a **5.8% rise** in industrial output, slightly above the **5.2%** increase from the previous year.

The annual growth was mainly driven by mining, with a **7.5%** increase, while manufacturing and electricity generation saw more modest rises. Capital goods and infrastructure/construction goods production saw the strongest growth, likely due to increased government spending.

On the consumer side, the production of durables and non-durables showed only a slight increase, indicating continued weak household consumption, which remains below pre-COVID levels. The uneven recovery in consumption, skewed towards higher-income households, and the contraction in employment-intensive manufacturing sectors pose challenges for economic growth. The government's next steps are crucial in addressing these issues to stimulate private investment and broader demand recovery.

### [Clickbait paper: on the EAC-PM working paper](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/clickbait-paper-on-the-eac-pm-working-paper/article68168032.ece)

The article discusses a working paper titled 'Share of Religious Minorities: a Cross-Country Analysis (1950-2015)' which has caused political controversy due to its findings on the changing demographics of religious groups in India. The paper, authored by economist Shamika Ravi and co-authors, uses the Religious Characteristics of States Dataset, 2017 (RCS-Dem) to show that the proportion of Hindus in India's population has declined from 84.68% to 78% between 1950 and 2015, while the Muslim population has increased from 9.84% to 14%. The paper points out that this trend is not unique to India but is consistent with global patterns of majority-religion decline. 

However, the authors controversially claim, without supporting data, that the increase in Muslim population in India indicates that reports of discrimination and violence against Muslims are false, and attribute the rise to "progressive policies and inclusive institutions." They compare this with Pakistan and Bangladesh, where they suggest "demographic shocks" have reduced Hindu populations. The paper has been criticized for lacking a thorough analysis and for making deductions that appear to contradict its own methodology. Critics argue that known factors such as declining fertility rates and economic migration are more likely explanations for the demographic trends observed in India. The endorsement of this paper by the Economic Advisory Council (EAC) to the Prime Minister has been questioned, as the paper's conclusions are seen as potentially incomplete or misleading.

### [Voting for relief: On interim bails and elections](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/voting-for-relief-delhi-cm-interim-bails-and-the-election/article68161655.ece)

The Supreme Court of India granted interim bail to Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, reversing his arrest that had raised concerns about fairness in the ongoing general election. Kejriwal's arrest in March for alleged corruption related to a liquor policy was seen as a threat to federalism and democracy, especially since it occurred during the election period. The Court justified the bail until June 1, to ensure his participation in the election doesn't compromise its integrity.

The bail conditions prohibit Kejriwal from the Delhi Secretariat and Chief Minister's office, and he agreed not to sign any official documents without the Lieutenant General's approval. Despite not responding to the Enforcement Directorate's summonses, the Court noted that the charges against him are based on statements from suspects-turned-approvers, whose credibility will be assessed during the trial. The article also discusses the broader implications of bail conditions and their influence on perceptions of political bias in the judiciary.

### [Folds and faults: on AlphaFold 3](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/folds-and-faults-on-alphafold-3/article68161671.ece)

The article discusses the advancements in solving the protein-folding problem, a key mystery in structural biology. It highlights the development of AlphaFold by DeepMind, an AI tool that predicts protein structures. The first version, AlphaFold, was released in 2018, followed by AlphaFold 2, and recently, AlphaFold 3. These tools have significantly improved our understanding of protein structures, with AlphaFold 3 capable of nearly 80% accuracy and modeling DNA, RNA, and other molecules.

However, the article points out that while these tools can predict how proteins fold, they do not explain why, leaving that to human scientists. It also mentions the uncertain impact of these advancements on drug discovery, as many drugs fail in clinical trials due to unforeseen interactions within the body. The article calls for DeepMind to consider alternative revenue models for AlphaFold 3, as its limited free use and undisclosed inner workings contrast with the open access to data used for its training, which was derived from publicly funded research. The article suggests that such cutting-edge tools should be more accessible, especially when they hold significant potential for healthcare advancements.

### [Turmoil and test: On Haryana politics](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/turmoil-and-test-on-haryana-politics/article68157885.ece)

The political landscape in Haryana is experiencing upheaval as three independent MLAs have withdrawn support from the BJP-led government. The JJP has offered to back the Congress to establish an alternative government. The BJP, now with 43 MLAs, is short of the majority mark in the 88-member assembly. Despite this, BJP leaders maintain that their government is stable, hinting at potential backing from discontented JJP MLAs.

Both the Congress and JJP are aggressively challenging the BJP but are cautiously navigating the process of potentially toppling the current government, each expecting the other to make the first move. They have called upon Governor Bandaru Dattatreya to step in, with the Congress seeking immediate elections under President's rule and the JJP requesting a 'floor test' to verify the government's majority.

Amidst the general elections and approaching Assembly elections, the Congress and JJP are working to strengthen their positions. The JJP, having distanced itself from the BJP, is particularly focused on rallying the agrarian Jat community, which forms its primary support base. The BJP's recent leadership change from Manohar Lal Khattar to Nayab Singh Saini reflects a strategic shift towards non-Jat voters, following historical inter-community tensions. The Congress is concentrating efforts on forming a stable government for the next five years, rather than seeking short-term advantages. The ongoing political uncertainty casts doubt on the Saini government's majority, prompting the need for the Governor's intervention to clarify the situation.

### [Bipartisan rescue: On the U.S. House of Representatives and U.S. politics](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/bipartisan-rescue-on-the-us-house-of-representatives-and-us-politics/article68157483.ece)

In a notable bipartisan effort, U.S. House Democrats joined forces with some Republicans to retain Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson, thwarting a challenge led by far-right Republican Marjorie Taylor Greene. Greene criticized Johnson for advancing a $95 billion aid package for Israel, Ukraine, and other allies, accusing him of undermining Republican influence and aiding Democrats. Despite this, the House voted overwhelmingly (359-43) to support Johnson's speakership.

The incident reflects the ongoing power struggle within the Republican Party, exacerbated by the upcoming presidential election. The House has previously experienced turmoil, such as the 15 rounds of voting needed for Johnson's predecessor, Kevin McCarthy, to secure the Speaker's position, only to be ousted by the House Freedom Caucus later. As the election nears, moderate Republicans face the challenge of balancing the need for bipartisan legislation with the pressure from Trump's popular far-right faction.

### [Irrational Israel: On the ceasefire proposal and Hamas](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/irrational-israel-on-the-ceasefire-proposal-and-hamas/article68153653.ece)

The article discusses the escalating conflict in Gaza following Hamas's acceptance of a ceasefire proposal mediated by Qatar and Egypt. Despite initial celebrations in Rafah, Israel rejected the proposal, stating it did not meet its core demands, and proceeded to send tanks to Rafah, seizing control of the border crossing with Egypt. The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) have been reported to have killed over 34,000 Palestinians and wounded over 77,000 since October 7, leading to widespread displacement and a humanitarian crisis, including a famine in northern Gaza.

The article criticizes the Israeli government's approach to the conflict, comparing it to the actions of Hamas and suggesting that Israel's military performance has not lived up to its historical reputation. It argues that a continued war would further isolate Israel internationally, especially with a genocide case pending at the UN's top court. The article concludes by advocating for a negotiated ceasefire that includes the release of all hostages and an IDF withdrawal, noting Hamas's willingness to agree to such terms. The question remains whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will agree to the ceasefire.

### [A sob story: on onion exports](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-sob-story-on-onion-exports/article68150034.ece)

The article discusses the Indian government's recent changes to onion export policies. After a six-month ban due to high prices and supply concerns, the government has categorized onion exports as 'free' with a minimum export price of $550 per tonne and an additional 40% levy. This decision follows an earlier allowance of 2,000 tonnes of white onion exports, which led to accusations of preferential treatment for Gujarat farmers just before the state's Lok Sabha vote. The Centre justified the export of white onions, which are more costly to produce, by stating it would aid Maharashtra, India's largest onion producer.

The timing of the export policy change is notable as it precedes the voting in Maharashtra's onion farming regions. The Centre argues that the decision is based on stable mandi prices and adequate supplies. However, the viability of exports is questionable due to the floor price and export duty, making them feasible only if domestic prices are around ₹64 per kilo or higher. The article also notes that international onion prices are decreasing as Egypt and Pakistan lifted their export restrictions earlier than India.

The article suggests that the export curbs, expected to last until the next government takes charge, will have lasted almost a year, potentially affecting farmers' decisions to sow onions. It highlights the need for nuanced policymaking, considering the long-term context of onion prices and the impact of export bans on farmers' incomes. The current policy does not seem to encourage sowing, which is detrimental to controlling inflation and achieving India's goal of becoming a global food supplier. The article concludes by reflecting on the complex balance between consumer interests and farmer welfare.

The article discusses the third round of polling for the 18th Lok Sabha, where over 1,300 candidates contested in 93 constituencies across 12 states and UTs. This phase marks the completion of voting in more than half of the total seats. A BJP candidate in Surat was elected unopposed after opposition candidates withdrew. The article highlights the BJP's strong position in Gujarat and a notable contest in Maharashtra's Baramati. It also covers the political debate over reservation policies, with the BJP and Congress offering conflicting views. Allegations of sexual crimes against Prajwal Revanna, a JD(S) MP, have created challenges for the BJP in Karnataka. The article suggests that both major parties are struggling to generate a decisive public wave in their favor for the ongoing elections.

The article discusses the ongoing dispute between Tamil Nadu and Kerala over the Mullaperiyar dam. Despite a Supreme Court judgment from 10 years ago, which allowed Tamil Nadu to store water up to 142 feet, issues remain unresolved. Tamil Nadu accuses Kerala of obstructing maintenance work on the dam, which is crucial for its safety. Although committees have been established to address these issues, no solution has been found. Tamil Nadu is pushing for a comprehensive dam safety evaluation by December 30, 2026, as required by the Dam Safety Act, 2021.

Judicial interventions have led to the adoption of a rule curve for operating the dam's shutters during floods, despite Kerala's objections. Additionally, a car parking project proposed by the Kerala government has become a subject of litigation, with Tamil Nadu disputing the project's location.

The article suggests that both states should engage in bilateral negotiations to resolve their differences while maintaining the option of legal recourse. It emphasizes the importance of proactive political leadership to prevent the exploitation of water and dam safety issues for emotional manipulation. The talks may not lead to a major breakthrough but could help both states understand each other's positions and prevent the situation from being aggravated by vested interests.

China asserted its badminton dominance by winning both the Thomas and Uber Cup titles in Chengdu, repeating their 2012 feat. The men's team, led by Shi Yu Qi, secured their 11th victory, overcoming a recent slump. The women's team, determined to bounce back from their 2022 loss to South Korea, showcased their strength with 24 consecutive wins. India's performance served as a pre-Olympic evaluation, with mixed results. Despite a quarter-final defeat to China in the Thomas Cup, players like H.S. Prannoy and Lakshya Sen showed promise, while the women's team gained valuable experience despite losses to China and Japan.

Rahul Gandhi, a prominent leader of the Indian National Congress, has decided to contest the upcoming elections from Rae Bareli, Uttar Pradesh, a constituency with strong familial ties. Despite previous losses in Amethi, he opted for Rae Bareli, where his mother Sonia Gandhi won in 2019. This decision comes after his victory in Wayanad, Kerala, in the last election. Some criticize his delayed announcement, suggesting it lacks clarity and decisiveness. Gandhi aims to combat the BJP's Hindutva politics and promote social justice, focusing on the Hindi belt and western regions. His entry into Uttar Pradesh's electoral arena could invigorate the opposition, particularly in alliance with the Samajwadi Party. However, the Congress faces a daunting challenge against the BJP's stronghold in the region. Winning both Wayanad and Rae Bareli would solidify Gandhi's stance against the BJP's ideology, signaling a long-term commitment to the ideological battle.

The article discusses the ongoing polling in Jammu and Kashmir and Ladakh, focusing on the challenges and dynamics surrounding voter turnout and political participation. It highlights the disparity in turnout between different regions, with higher participation in Jammu compared to low turnout in the Kashmir Valley, attributed to disillusionment over political changes and central rule.

In April, GST revenues surpassed ₹2 lakh crore for the first time, marking a 12.4% increase from the previous year. This spike is typical for April due to year-end tax activities. While this might not become the new norm, continued economic momentum could sustain growth. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman hailed this as a significant achievement, citing a strong economy and improved collection efficiency. The focus now shifts to GST reform, aiming for simplicity and expansion of the tax base.

Goldman Sachs' report titled 'India’s rise as the emerging services factory of the world' analyzes India's significant growth in providing global services over the past 18 years. The report highlights the rapid expansion of India's services exports, particularly in sectors like professional consulting and financial services. Despite challenges such as the current cautious outlook for the IT services sector, the report forecasts continued growth in services exports, projecting them to reach $800 billion by 2030. However, it also emphasizes the need for attention to constraints such as skill development for graduates and environmental stresses in regions of concentrated growth. The report suggests a calibrated approach, including efforts to expand global market access and facilitate innovation in emerging sectors like artificial intelligence and blockchain applications, to sustain India's services success story.

It suggests a trend where only leaders from opposing parties face legal action, while those aligning with the ruling party often escape scrutiny. Kejriwal's arrest is seen as politically motivated, linked to allegations of kickbacks related to a favorable liquor policy. The article questions the timing and necessity of his arrest, emphasizing the need for agencies to prosecute without overly relying on the cooperation of the accused. It raises concerns about the potential subversion of federalism and democracy by arresting and keeping serving Chief Ministers in prison during elections.

The article discusses the voter turnout trends in the second phase of the general election, highlighting high turnout in East and North East India and lower turnout in Bihar and Uttar Pradesh. It suggests that reduced turnout compared to 2019 may indicate decreased voter enthusiasm, potentially concerning for the BJP. The piece also analyzes Prime Minister Narendra Modi's campaign strategies, noting his focus on communal rhetoric and criticism of the Congress manifesto. It explores the BJP's historical success in mobilizing OBC voters and the Congress's attempt to revive through alliances with Mandal parties. The article concludes by posing questions about how voters will respond to these campaign tactics and their expectations for jobs and livelihoods, which will shape the election's outcome in subsequent phases.

### [Towards a green growth: On the RBI and a green taxonomy](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/towards-a-green-growth-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-rbi-and-a-green-taxonomy/article68117880.ece)

The Reserve Bank of India's latest Monetary Policy Report emphasizes the significant impact of extreme weather events and climate shocks on both food inflation and the natural rate of interest, which affects financial stability. It utilizes a New-Keynesian model to estimate the macroeconomic impact of climate change, projecting a potential 9% decrease in long-term economic output by 2050 without mitigation policies. The RBI has been gradually addressing climate risks since its July 2022 discussion paper on sustainable finance. Despite issuing Sovereign Green Bonds and allowing Foreign Institutional Investors to participate in green government securities, there's a call for a comprehensive assessment of the economic and financial stability impact of climate change. The RBI is urged to develop a layered green taxonomy reflective of India's developmental trajectories to mitigate transitional risks as the economy moves towards sustainability.

The Supreme Court of India has rejected the demand for 100% verification of the paper trail from electronic voting machines, citing confidence in the current system's integrity, particularly with the introduction of the VVPAT. Rejecting the idea of reverting to paper ballots as regressive, the court has declined previous requests for increased verification percentages. Instead, it has directed measures to secure symbol loading units and allow for verification of micro-controllers in a portion of EVMs. Despite earlier rulings emphasizing the necessity of a paper trail, the current debate reflects a level of mistrust in the Election Commission of India, highlighting the importance of both voter confidence and the perceived impartiality of the election watchdog.

### [Aid for war: On the United States Senate and aid package](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/aid-for-war-on-the-united-states-senate-and-aid-package/article68110159.ece)

The United States Senate has passed a $95 billion aid package for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan with bipartisan support. The package, composed of four bills, includes funds for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan, and the Indo-Pacific region. Despite initial opposition, the bill received strong support, constituting a significant win for President Biden and bipartisan lawmakers. However, opposition from the far-right wing of the Republican Party, including the House Freedom Caucus, threatened the bill's passage. The aid package is likely to be the last one approved until after the upcoming elections, which could potentially shift the political landscape.

### [Courting action: On FMCG marketing, advertising](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/courting-action-on-fmcg-marketing-advertising/article68106567.ece)

The Supreme Court, led by Justice Hima Kohli, has expanded its scrutiny beyond Patanjali Ayurved to include all FMCG companies advertising misleading claims. This move comes in response to concerns about the proliferation of unscientific claims, especially regarding health products like COVID-19 cures and baby formula. The court has criticized the government's inaction and the ineffective regulatory apparatus for misleading advertisements, emphasizing the need for prompt enforcement. While civil society has taken up the task of calling out such claims, there is a lack of protection for those who do so. The article argues that while the judiciary should take exemplary action against violators, it should not overstep its role by encroaching on legislative and executive powers.

### [Stability in Maldives: On the election results and India ties](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/stability-in-maldives-on-the-election-results-and-india-ties/article68106599.ece)

Maldives President Mohammad Muizzu's party, the PNC, secured a significant victory in parliamentary elections, gaining a "super-majority" in the People’s Majlis. This gives Muizzu substantial power to pass laws and potentially amend the constitution. The opposition, particularly the MDP, perceived as "pro-India," performed poorly. Muizzu's international engagements, including visits to China, Turkey, and the UAE, and a distancing from India, have garnered domestic approval. However, concerns arise over potential majoritarian trends in India and strained Indo-Maldivian ties. The article suggests the need for a balanced foreign policy by Muizzu and emphasizes the importance of maintaining strong ties with India amidst Maldives' economic, climate, and geopolitical challenges.

### [Surat symptoms: On the BJP and the elimination of political contest](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/surat-symptoms-on-the-elimination-of-political-contest/article68102493.ece)

The article discusses a significant concern for Indian democracy, highlighting the uncontested election of a Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) candidate in Surat, Gujarat. The BJP candidate was elected unopposed to the Lok Sabha after various irregularities were reported, such as alleged forgery of signatures on the nomination papers of the Congress candidate and the withdrawal of other candidates. This event has raised questions about the use of state power and the undermining of democratic processes. The article suggests that such practices threaten the essence of democracy, which is built on the contest of ideas and political mobilization. It emphasizes the need for the BJP to foster a political culture where differences are resolved through fair and open contests, rather than eliminating opposition, to maintain the democratic spirit of India.

### [Hot button: On the voter and heat exposure](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/hot-button-on-the-voter-and-heat-exposure/article68102378.ece)

The Election Commission of India (ECI) is concerned that high temperatures might have deterred voters during the initial phase of the general election. They've formed a task force with various agencies to evaluate heat conditions before each polling phase and ensure polling booths have necessary facilities. While the IMD issues heat wave warnings based on temperature, they don't consider people's actual experience of heat. Measures like adjusting polling dates and providing shaded areas, hydration options, and medical services at booths could help mitigate heat-related issues and encourage voter turnout. Additionally, collaboration with health authorities is essential for collecting data on heat-related health issues and implementing long-term solutions.

Activists Aruna Roy and Nikhil Dey have challenged the imposition of prohibitory orders during election time in India, arguing that such blanket restrictions hinder public participation in the democratic process. They argue that while political parties can obtain permission for rallies and meetings, civil society groups often face a lack of response to their applications. The Supreme Court is examining the constitutionality of these orders, questioning whether they unduly limit fundamental rights. The court has directed executive magistrates to decide on public meeting applications within three days. The case also raises concerns about the Election Commission's role in such restrictions and whether statutory powers can be transferred to it.

The article criticizes Prime Minister Narendra Modi's political tactics, highlighting his reliance on right-wing rhetoric, including hate speech against minorities and the use of dog whistles to appeal to bigoted supporters. It refutes Modi's recent claims about the Congress party distributing wealth among Muslims and misrepresenting statements made by former Prime Minister Manmohan Singh. The article discusses wealth inequality under BJP rule and refutes Modi's assertions about Muslims and wealth distribution. It also addresses the misuse of social justice and egalitarianism concepts by parties like the BJP to distract from issues of equity and casteism, emphasizing the contamination of India's public sphere with disinformation.

The IMF has raised its forecast for global economic growth in 2024 to 3.2%, citing resilience despite adverse shocks and central bank interest rate hikes, primarily driven by advanced economies led by the U.S. However, there's a growing disparity between low-income developing countries and the rest of the world, with downward growth revisions and increased inflation. These countries, particularly in Africa and parts of Latin America, the Pacific islands, and Asia, are struggling to recover from the COVID-19 pandemic's impact, compounded by mounting debt burdens hindering investment in crucial public goods like education and healthcare. The World Bank warns of a historic reversal of development, with half of the world's 75 poorest countries experiencing widening income gaps with wealthier nations. It emphasizes the need for richer countries to financially support the poorest ones to tap into their economic potential for universal peace and prosperity.

In the first phase of the 18th Lok Sabha elections, approximately 62.3% of voters turned out across 21 States and Union Territories, with 1,625 candidates competing for 102 Lok Sabha seats. Despite isolated incidents of violence, polling was mostly peaceful. Tamil Nadu saw all 39 Lok Sabha seats contested, with the BJP making a significant push into the state's political landscape. With the BJP aiming to expand beyond its traditional strongholds, including parts of Rajasthan, Madhya Pradesh, and Uttar Pradesh, its focus on Tamil Nadu signifies a strategic and ideological shift. The BJP's success in this endeavor will only be revealed after the votes are counted, but its aggressive campaigning in the first phase indicates the seriousness of its efforts to gain traction in southern India.

The article discusses the current state of the conflict against Maoist insurgents in India, particularly in the Bastar region of Chhattisgarh. While recent military actions have weakened the Maoists, they still pose a threat to security forces, especially in difficult terrain. The Indian government's approach involves a combination of military tactics and welfare measures to win over tribal populations. However, the Maoists continue to resist, refusing to abandon their ideology despite setbacks. Civil society attempts to broker peace have been unsuccessful so far, leaving the conflict in a state of ongoing attrition.

### [Pale green shoots: On exports](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/pale-green-shoots-on-exports/article68080198.ece)

India's merchandise exports reached a 12-month peak of $41.7 billion, slightly lower than the previous year but higher than February's figures. Imports decreased by 6% to $57.3 billion, resulting in the trade deficit hitting an 11-month low. Despite challenges like geopolitical tensions, India's export growth has remained positive, partly due to resilient demand in major markets. The decline in commodity prices has also contributed to this outcome. The World Trade Organization has revised down its global trade volume growth projection, but Asia, including India, is expected to see export and import volumes rise in 2024. However, there are looming risks such as disruptions in key shipping routes and geopolitical tensions, which could impact trade dynamics. Rising shipping costs may compel exporters to raise prices, affecting competitiveness. Additionally, India's vulnerability to fluctuations in crude oil prices poses a significant threat to its trade balance and macroeconomic stability.

### [Rain shocks: On the monsoon in 2024](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/rain-shocks-on-the-monsoon-in-2024/article68071987.ece)

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has predicted a monsoon with **6% more rainfall** than the average, which could be good news for the southern states currently experiencing heatwaves. However, there's a risk of **excessive rains**, with a 30% chance of exceeding the norm by more than 10%. The forecast is based on the expected development of a La Niña event and a positive Indian Ocean Dipole, which are likely to bring significant rains in August and September. While this may benefit agriculture, there's a concern for potential **extreme floods** that could cause substantial damage, as seen in the past. The IMD has not commented on the expected rainfall for June and July but anticipates neutral conditions. Given the risks, it's crucial for states to prepare emergency plans and for farmers to be informed about the monsoon's second half to plan their sowing accordingly. An update to the forecast is expected by the end of May.

The article discusses the delayed implementation of the Madurai branch of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences (AIIMS). Although the idea behind establishing AIIMS across India was to improve healthcare accessibility and education, the execution has been marred by issues such as inadequate infrastructure and manpower constraints. Despite being a prestigious project, the construction of AIIMS Madurai has faced significant delays, leading to protests from students who are currently accommodated in a nearby facility. The article highlights the political ramifications of the project's delay, especially during the 2021 Assembly elections in Tamil Nadu. It emphasizes the need for effective collaboration between the central and state governments to ensure timely completion of such vital healthcare institutions and to address the persisting doctor-patient ratio imbalance in the country.

The CSDS-Lokniti pre-poll survey for the 2024 General Elections in India highlights that unemployment and price rise are the primary concerns for voters, reflecting the country's economic challenges. Despite the BJP government's focus on issues like the Ram temple and Hindutva, these do not resonate as strongly with voters compared to economic issues. However, the survey also suggests that the BJP still holds a lead over its rivals due to perceptions of leadership and socio-cultural issues. The survey underscores a significant divide between voter concerns and political messaging, presenting opportunities and challenges for both the ruling party and the opposition. Additionally, there's a notable erosion of trust in the Election Commission of India, signaling a need for the institution to address concerns and assert its independence.

### [Step back: On Iran-Israel tensions](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/step-back-on-iran-israel-tensions/article68072172.ece)

The article discusses the escalating tensions in West Asia following Iran's drone and missile attack on Israel on April 14, 2024. This attack was in retaliation for the bombing of the Iranian embassy in Damascus. The conflict has reached a critical point with the potential to spark an all-out war. Iran's action, which resulted in the loss of key military figures, was described as self-defense. Israel, with support from international allies, managed to intercept most of the projectiles. Despite calls for restraint from allies, Israel has promised to respond to Iran's aggression.

The situation in West Asia is described as complex, with past events such as Israel's siege of Palestinian territories and attacks on Gaza contributing to the current tensions. The U.S.'s failure to control Israel's actions and Iran's support for groups like Hezbollah and Hamas have also exacerbated the situation. The article suggests that Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu's policies have been unsuccessful and have brought the region to the verge of war. It concludes by urging Israel to consider the success of its missile defense as a victory and to de-escalate the situation to prevent a regional war, which could have catastrophic consequences for the entire region.

The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has released its manifesto for the 2024 general election, seeking a third term under Prime Minister Narendra Modi. The manifesto highlights the BJP's achievements from the past two terms, including the revocation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status under Article 370, the inauguration of the Ram temple in Ayodhya, and the implementation of various welfare schemes such as the free grain scheme and housing programs. It claims that these efforts have lifted 25 crore people out of poverty.

The BJP promises to continue its strong governance to navigate global instability and pledges to implement the Citizenship (Amendment) Act and a law for women's reservations. It avoids taking a stance on a caste census but notes the 10% reservation for Economically Weaker Sections. A new promise includes a health-care guarantee of up to ₹5 lakh for senior citizens. Notably, the manifesto does not mention the National Register of Citizens, which has been a contentious issue.

The manifesto, titled 'Modi’s Guarantee,' appeals to the rural, youth, farmers, women, and the new middle class, collectively referred to as the GYANM segment. It emphasizes continuity in India's trajectory over the last decade and Mr. Modi's personal appeal. The document suggests that while the BJP has recounted its welfare schemes and achievements, the promises for the next term should be more substantial, leaving it to the voters to weigh these promises against the party's track record.

The article discusses the upcoming general elections in Karnataka, highlighting the political landscape dominated by the Congress and the BJP-JD(S) alliance. Despite recent incidents like the Rameshwaram Cafe blast, the BJP has refrained from exploiting them for communal gains, possibly learning from past electoral setbacks. The Congress, buoyed by the implementation of its 'five guarantees,' aims to challenge the BJP's dominance. However, the BJP's steady success in previous Lok Sabha elections poses a challenge, though its performance might not be replicated. The article also touches upon contentious issues like reservation policies and their impact on electoral dynamics.

India's retail inflation dipped to **4.85%** in March, marking the first time in five months it fell below 5%. This slight decrease from February's **5.1%** is the lowest since May 2023. The final quarter of 2023-24 saw an average inflation of 5%, aligning with RBI's projections and representing the slowest rate in three years. The annual consumer price rise averaged at **5.4%**, a four-year low. Core inflation, excluding food and energy, remained below 4% for four consecutive months. Fuel inflation reached a four-year low at **-2.7%** in March. Despite reductions in fuel and gas prices, high food costs and rising inflation for rural consumers due to a weak monsoon are concerns. Food inflation averaged **8%** in 2023-24, with entrenched inflation in vegetables, pulses, and spices. Urban inflation was **4.14%** in March, but rural inflation increased to **5.45%**. The RBI aims for a 4% inflation rate, but external factors like oil price surges and global economic conditions present challenges ahead.

Ecuador's recent raid on the Mexican embassy in Quito to arrest former Vice-President Jorge Glas for corruption charges has sparked a significant diplomatic dispute, violating the Vienna Convention. Glas, along with ex-President Rafael Correa, claims political persecution, but current President Daniel Noboa views it as a stand against corruption. The incident escalated after Mexico granted asylum to Glas and Ecuador responded by declaring Mexico's ambassador persona non grata. This action led to Mexico seeking Ecuador's expulsion from the UN through the International Court of Justice. Domestically, Noboa faces criticism over rampant gang violence and a plummeting approval rating. Critics argue that Noboa is leveraging the diplomatic row to bolster his political position amidst a referendum on increasing government powers to combat gang violence, while failing to address the underlying issues within legal boundaries.

The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has updated its forecast for India's GDP growth for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2025, to **7%** from the previous **6.7%**. This adjustment is attributed to strong public and private investment and the anticipation of a recovery in consumer demand as the rural economy improves. For the following fiscal year 2025-26, the ADB projects a **7.2%** growth.

Despite this, the ADB's projection is more conservative than the **7.6%** growth estimated by India's National Statistical Office for the year ending March 31. The ADB warns that its forecast is subject to global economic risks, such as a significant increase in oil prices or sustained high interest rates in Western countries, which could impact India due to the rupee's sensitivity to these rates.

The report also highlights a discrepancy between the Centre's strong capital expenditure and the private sector's lagging project completions compared to new project announcements. Notably, the ADB did not comment on the controversies regarding the accuracy of India's national income data or the influence of government tax receipts on the GDP figures.

Furthermore, the ADB did not address the lack of significant structural reforms in India post-COVID-19, which has raised questions about the government's reported strong growth numbers. Risks to consumer spending have been identified, with household savings at near all-time lows, potentially affecting the projected growth.

The ADB recommends that India establish large-scale special economic zones to boost exports and better integrate with global supply chains, especially considering the volatile situation in West Asia and disruptions to shipping routes through the Red Sea. Improving logistics infrastructure is also advised to support these efforts.

### [Free the messenger: On the Julian Assange case](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/free-the-messenger-on-the-julian-assange-case/article68058325.ece)

President Biden's recent remarks about considering a request from Australian Prime Minister Albanese to drop charges against Julian Assange have sparked hope among Assange's family and supporters. Assange, currently in the UK's Belmarsh Prison, faces extradition to the US over charges related to WikiLeaks' publication of classified US documents in 2010. Albanese's appeal could potentially influence the pending British court decision on Assange's extradition. Assange's family argues that he has already faced significant punishment and is in poor health. His US charges carry a potential sentence of 175 years, mostly under the Espionage Act. While WikiLeaks' actions have raised concerns about national security and responsible journalism, the US's selective prosecution of Assange over his source, Chelsea Manning, appears inconsistent. The Biden administration's stated commitment to global democracy and free speech seems contradictory in light of Assange's continued prosecution. The case presents an opportunity for the US to demonstrate its support for democratic freedoms and transparency.

Telangana is gearing up for heavily contested general elections, with the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) losing ground and various parties seeing crossovers. The Congress has gained momentum, with a notable increase in vote share since the 2018 Assembly elections. Under Chief Minister A. Revanth Reddy, there's been a shift in public perception towards governance, with emphasis on inclusivity, symbolized by the Dalit Deputy Chief Minister occupying the former Chief Minister's residence. Despite some welfare measures yet to be fully implemented, recent high-profile defections from the BRS to the Congress, such as Kadiyam Srihari and K. Keshava Rao, indicate a decline in the BRS's prospects. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has also doubled its vote share, setting the stage for a three-pronged race in Telangana. The All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen remains a significant player.

The Supreme Court of India has utilized its exceptional powers to overturn its own 2021 judgment and alleviate the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) of a significant financial burden of ₹7,687 crore in a dispute with a former concessionaire. This decision highlights the Court's curative jurisdiction and the potential conflict between litigation finality and substantive justice. The case involved a dispute between DMRC and Delhi Airport Metro Express Private Ltd. (DAMEPL), with an arbitral tribunal ruling in favor of DAMEPL in 2017. Despite a previous Supreme Court ruling restoring the arbitral award, a curative petition was filed, leading to a review of the case. The article emphasizes the significance of arbitrators and judges ensuring accuracy in both fact and law to avoid discouraging commercial litigants from arbitration.

The article discusses recent revelations regarding donations made to political parties in India through electoral bonds, particularly focusing on donations received by the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The investigation found that numerous companies with significant losses donated large sums of money, raising concerns about potential money laundering, tax evasion, and the use of shell companies. Despite apprehensions from officials at institutions like the Reserve Bank of India and the Election Commission, the scheme was implemented by the Union Finance Ministry. The Supreme Court's intervention in compelling disclosure of information on these donations is seen as a positive step, but questions remain about the legality and transparency of campaign financing. The article calls for thorough investigations by Parliament and regulatory institutions to ensure accountability and transparency in electoral financing, emphasizing the importance of a clean-up for a healthy democracy.

In Maharashtra's complex political landscape, there are two factions of the Shiv Sena and the Nationalist Congress Party (NCP), each aligned with opposing alliances around the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) and the Congress. The Uddhav Thackeray-led Shiv Sena, along with the Congress and NCP, forms the Maha Vikas Aghadi (MVA), set to contest 21, 17, and 10 Lok Sabha constituencies respectively out of the state's 48. This arrangement was reached after significant concessions from each party to ensure unity against the Mahayuti coalition, comprising the BJP, another faction of the Shiv Sena, and Ajit Pawar's NCP.

The Shiv Sena will contest in all five regions of Maharashtra, while the NCP will focus on seats with higher chances of winning, mainly in the sugar belt of western Maharashtra. The Congress's seats are spread across different regions, leaving out the Konkan region and most Mumbai seats.

The political landscape has undergone significant shifts since 2019, with Thackeray switching sides, triggering new alliances and splits within parties. Challenges remain as resentment and rebellion need to be managed within the alliances. For instance, the Pawar family split between two parties, with Ajit Pawar's wife contesting against his cousin in Baramati.

The upcoming Lok Sabha elections will test the popularity of the transformed political landscape, with the MVA aiming to keep various factions within its fold, including Prakash Ambedkar's Vanchit Bahujan Aghadi. The state's significance for the BJP's national strategy is highlighted by its past electoral success and the upcoming campaign, which will likely focus on Prime Minister Narendra Modi.

### [A distinct right: On climate change and species protection](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-distinct-right-the-hindu-editorial-on-climate-change-and-species-protection/article68047064.ece)

The Supreme Court of India has recognized the right to be free from the adverse effects of climate change as a distinct fundamental right, furthering the case for a healthy environment and sustainable development. While the right to live in a clean environment was already acknowledged under Article 21 of the Constitution, the Court now reasons that protection from climate change is inseparable from this right. Climate change's impacts, from rising temperatures to food shortages, disproportionately affect marginalized communities, violating their right to equality. The Court's emphasis on climate change arose in a case concerning the deaths of the Great Indian Bustard due to solar power transmission lines, highlighting the challenge of balancing environmental conservation with renewable energy development. The Court has called for an expert committee to address this issue, emphasizing the urgency of finding a solution that reconciles environmental protection with sustainable development goals.

### [Gross mismanagement: On TB drug shortages and India’s national TB programme](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/gross-mismanagement-the-hindu-editorial-on-tb-drug-shortages-and-indias-national-tb-programme/article68047044.ece)

India, known as the pharmacy of the Global South, is facing a concerning shortage of tuberculosis (TB) drugs, hindering efforts to eliminate the disease by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's set deadline in 2025. The shortage extends to critical medications for drug-sensitive TB and multidrug-resistant TB (MDR-TB). Disruptions in drug supply have been ongoing since 2022, with recent instances of acute shortages occurring just seven months ago. This scarcity exacerbates existing challenges in TB care, including delays in diagnosis and treatment initiation, as well as treatment failure. The situation is worsened by the National TB Elimination Programme's failure to ensure consistent drug availability, despite being manufactured domestically by multiple companies. Furthermore, the Health Ministry's decision to allow states to procure drugs locally at the last minute adds complexity and undermines efforts to provide free treatment to patients, many of whom come from economically disadvantaged backgrounds. Overall, India's struggle with TB drug shortages highlights significant shortcomings in its TB control efforts and raises doubts about the country's ability to meet its elimination goals.

### [Promise or perish: On political parties and their manifestos](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/promise-or-perish-the-hindu-editorial-on-political-parties-and-their-manifestos/article68043276.ece)

The article discusses the release of the Congress party's manifesto, titled Nyay Patra (Document for Justice), for the 2024 elections in India. The manifesto outlines the party's vision for governance and policies, aiming to counter the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party's ideological agenda. It includes 25 guarantees focusing on social justice, economy, and constitutional institutions, aiming to reverse what they perceive as damage done by the current government. 

Key promises include removing the 50% cap on reservation for marginalized communities and conducting a caste census, which marks a departure from Congress's historical stance on caste politics. Other pledges include ensuring bail is the norm, reviewing laws affecting privacy and personal choices, regulating media, and safeguarding internet freedom.

Welfare schemes proposed include cash transfers, guaranteed minimum support prices for farmers, universal health insurance, apprenticeship opportunities, and debt relief for educational loans. However, the article suggests that while these proposals aim to differentiate Congress from BJP, they lack innovation and may not fully address concerns about Congress's governance track record.

### [Perverse intent: On the Citizenship (Amendment) Act](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/perverse-intent-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-citizenship-amendment-act/article68043953.ece)

The article criticizes the Citizenship (Amendment) Act (CAA) in India, which offers citizenship to migrants fleeing persecution but limits it to certain neighboring countries and to those facing religious persecution, excluding Muslims, atheists, and others. It argues that this selective approach goes against the Indian Constitution's ethos and ignores persecution based on factors like language. The piece highlights the plight of Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar and discrimination against minority Islamic sects in Muslim-majority countries. Additionally, it notes concerns about the CAA allowing for dual citizenship, which violates Indian citizenship laws. The article suggests that if India were a signatory to international refugee conventions, the CAA would likely be deemed discriminatory. It calls for the Supreme Court to declare the CAA unconstitutional due to its arbitrary and selective nature.

### [Wayward elephant: On the RBI’s rate decision](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/wayward-elephant-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-rbis-rate-decision/article68039433.ece)

The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) has chosen to maintain the benchmark policy repo rate at 6.5% for the seventh consecutive meeting. This decision is attributed to persistent food price pressures, hindering efforts to stabilize inflation at the 4% target. RBI Governor Shaktikanta Das likened inflation to an "elephant in the room," expressing the need for it to return to the "forest" on a lasting basis. Despite projections indicating a slight decrease in inflation in the coming months, concerns persist as it has remained above target for 53 months. However, the MPC is optimistic about economic growth, forecasting a 7% expansion in GDP for the year ending March 2025. Factors such as a normal monsoon, sustained momentum in manufacturing and services, and improved consumer confidence contribute to this outlook. The focus on inflation targeting is justified by the belief that stable prices are crucial for sustaining economic growth.

The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has warned that more heatwaves are likely this summer, particularly in Andhra Pradesh, Gujarat, and Maharashtra. Heatwave days are defined as when temperatures are at least 4.5° C above normal or exceed 45° C for two consecutive days. The causes include the cyclical El Niño wave, which dries up rainfall and raises temperatures, as well as overall warming temperatures contributing to less moisture in the air and hotter ground temperatures. This year, the warnings are especially concerning as millions are expected to line up at polling stations during the April and May elections, posing health risks. Despite previous incidents of deaths and hospitalizations due to heat, there is a lack of adequate preparation and response from the governmental machinery. The Election Commission of India has issued generic advisories for managing heat during elections, but there is a need for more specific measures, such as prioritizing cooling at polling stations. With the increasing severity of heatwaves and their impact on health, there is a call for innovative approaches to address this crisis within the electoral process.

The article discusses the critical role of Uttar Pradesh (UP) in Indian politics, particularly in the upcoming general elections. With 80 Lok Sabha seats, UP is crucial for parties like the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), which has historically performed well there. The BJP and the Samajwadi Party (SP) are the main contenders, with the Bahujan Samaj Party (BSP) led by Mayawati contesting independently. Other regional parties like the All India Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (AIMIM) are also trying to establish their presence. Various sub-regional outfits, often representing specific caste groups, are forming alliances with larger parties. The article notes the BJP's efforts to consolidate support, especially with the inclusion of the Rashtriya Lok Dal (RLD), which has influence among the agrarian Jat community. On the opposition side, the SP and Congress have formed alliances with parties like the Mahan Dal. However, challenges remain, particularly for the BSP, which has seen a decline in support. Despite the BJP's dominance in recent years, UP politics remains fragmented along caste, religious, and regional lines. The article concludes that the opposition needs a significant win in UP to pose a viable alternative at the national level.

### [Escalation ladder: On Israel’s offensive, and the danger ahead](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/escalation-ladder-on-israels-offensive-and-the-danger-ahead/article68032794.ece)

The article discusses the escalation of conflict in West Asia following the April 1 attack on an annex of the Iranian embassy in Damascus. Iran accuses Israel of the strike, which resulted in the death of 13 Iranians, including a top commander. Unlike previous strikes targeting Iranian military and nuclear figures, this attack targeted diplomatic premises, raising concerns about violations of international law.

Tensions between Israel and Iran have been ongoing, exacerbated by Israel's offensive actions in Gaza and air strikes in Syria and Lebanon. Despite facing pressure to cease fire and resign, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu appears inclined to escalate the regional crisis. The article warns against the consequences of an open war between Israel and Iran, urging Iran to show strategic patience and restraint while calling on the U.S. to restrain Israel from acting recklessly.

The article discusses the ongoing debate surrounding the use of Electronic Voting Machines (EVMs) in Indian elections, despite the introduction of the Voter Verifiable Paper Audit Trail (VVPAT) system. Critics argue that maintaining a machine audit trail of all commands executed could enhance transparency and security. Others express concerns about potential vulnerabilities introduced by VVPATs. However, there's been no proof of tampering with EVMs. The Supreme Court of India is considering petitions regarding demands for a 100% recount of all VVPATs for full transparency. Despite glitches, the mismatch between VVPAT and EVM counts has been minimal. Solutions proposed include increasing the recount sample size or targeting recounts in closely contested seats. Overall, the debate reflects a lack of trust in EVMs and highlights the need for continuous improvements in election technology and processes.

The Candidates chess tournament has begun in Toronto, with players competing for a chance to challenge the reigning world champions, Ding Liren and Ju Wenjun. Five out of the 16 contestants are Indian, including R. Praggnanandhaa, D. Gukesh, Vidit Gujrathi, Koneru Humpy, and R. Vaishali. This strong Indian presence reflects the country's growing strength in world chess. Notable contenders in the tournament include Fabiano Caruana, Hikaru Nakamura, Ian Nepomniachtchi, and Alireza Firouzja. Praggnanandhaa and Gukesh, both teenagers, have the potential to surprise the field, while Koneru Humpy and Vaishali are experienced players in the women's section. The tournament is expected to be highly competitive, with the women's event appearing more open.

The Supreme Court of India has referred a suit filed by Kerala, challenging the Centre's decisions on its borrowings, to a Constitution Bench. While the Court didn't grant an interim order to restore Kerala's borrowing position, the referral allows a larger Bench to examine the extent of the Union government's power to regulate a State's borrowings. This dispute is more than just fiscal mismanagement allegations; it's about the constitutional balance between the Centre and States. Kerala argues that the Centre can only impose conditions on borrowings from itself, not on all State loans. The Union defends its actions, citing concerns about national fiscal health and preventing off-budget borrowings. The issue is crucial as it affects States' fiscal space, especially given the current revenue distribution formula under the Goods and Services Tax. The Supreme Court will determine how strictly the Centre can enforce borrowing limits without violating federal norms.

The Supreme Court of India recently issued a contempt notice against Patanjali Ayurved for publishing misleading advertisements, despite previous assurances not to do so. The Court also threatened Baba Ramdev, co-founder of Patanjali, with perjury proceedings. The government was criticized for not taking action against Patanjali's false claims, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patanjali continued to make misleading claims about its products' ability to cure diseases, including COVID-19, despite warnings from the Court. The government's lack of intervention raises concerns about its support for the company's actions. This situation highlights the potential dangers of prioritizing commercial interests over public health and safety in the field of medicine.

### [A reform window: On the GST trajectory](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-reform-window-on-the-gst-trajectory/article68020253.ece)

The article discusses the positive trends in tax collections in India for the financial year 2023-24. Net direct tax collections rose by 19.9% by mid-March, nearing 97% of revised Budget targets, while Goods and Services Tax (GST) revenues reached ₹20.18 lakh crore. March saw the second-highest GST revenues since its rollout, with a possibility of crossing ₹2 lakh crore. Despite a lower growth rate compared to the previous year, the consistent revenue growth establishes a new normal for the economy. The government has tightened measures against tax evasion, contributing to the increase in collections. However, there's a slight concern over a decline in GST on goods imports, signaling potential cutbacks in discretionary consumption. The article suggests focusing on GST reforms, including rationalizing multiple tax rates and reducing high levies on certain products. Additionally, it emphasizes the need to wind down the GST Compensation Cess and resist introducing new levies, except for demerit goods like tobacco.

The article criticizes the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Palestine conflict, labeling it as a new low for American leadership. Despite widespread condemnation of Israel's actions, including accusations of war crimes, the U.S. has continued to support Israel with military aid and sales, even during periods of intense violence. The author argues that previous U.S. presidents have used leverage to influence Israel's behavior, but Biden has failed to do so, leading to significant Palestinian casualties and suffering. The article calls on the Biden administration to take a stronger stance, calling for an immediate ceasefire, increased aid to Gaza, and an end to arms sales to Israel if the violence continues.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently stirred controversy by politicizing the issue of Katchatheevu, an island with implications for India-Sri Lanka relations, for electoral purposes. He claimed that the Congress had irresponsibly surrendered Katchatheevu. However, both Congress and BJP governments have recognized the island as part of Sri Lanka. The dispute revolves around whether Congress leaders handled the matter carelessly, with documents suggesting that historical and legal factors favored Sri Lanka's sovereignty over the island. While it's common for Tamil Nadu politicians to demand the island's return, Modi's involvement could escalate tensions.

The Indian government has implemented a policy to encourage the use of domestically manufactured solar panels over imports. The policy requires solar module makers to undergo inspections by the National Institute of Solar Energy to be certified as 'approved' manufacturers. This certification allows companies to compete for government tenders, including those for the PM solar rooftop scheme. The aim is to reduce reliance on imported panels, particularly from China, and meet ambitious renewable energy targets. However, the domestic industry currently struggles to meet demand, and the policy aims to strike a balance between promoting domestic production and ensuring affordability and quality.

The article discusses the current political landscape in India, characterized by the dominance of the Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). The BJP has emerged as a strong competitor in most states, posing challenges for other parties, particularly the Indian National Congress. To counter the BJP, the Congress forms alliances with regional parties, forming what is termed the "INDIA bloc." In states like Bihar, where the BJP has a significant presence, the INDIA bloc, comprising the RJD, Congress, and Left parties, aims to challenge the ruling alliance. However, the alliance faces challenges such as seat-sharing issues and the inclusion of controversial figures like Pappu Yadav in the Congress. Despite this, the article emphasizes the need for parties to move beyond narrow identity politics and focus on social justice to effectively counter the BJP's rise.

The article highlights the alarming water scarcity situation in South India, with only 23% of reservoirs filled, nine percentage points lower than the rolling decadal average. Several factors contribute to the severity of the crisis, including ongoing El Niño events, predicted record-breaking temperatures, upcoming general elections leading to increased outdoor activities, and persistent issues like urban growth and groundwater depletion. Climate change exacerbates the situation by creating simultaneous crises, compounding socio-economic challenges, especially for low- and middle-income countries like India. The article emphasizes the need for governments to address water management issues and learn from past crises to mitigate future challenges.

The Centre's fiscal deficit has widened significantly, reaching ₹15 lakh crore by the end of February, up from ₹11 lakh crore in January. This represents 86.5% of the revised target of ₹17.3 lakh crore. Factors contributing to this increase include higher transfers to states and increased capital expenditure. The government aims to narrow the deficit to 4.5% of GDP by 2025-26, with a target of 5.1% for 2024-25. However, achieving this may require recalibration, considering factors like inflation, monsoon conditions, and consumption demand. Some ministries still have significant spending room available for March, but missing spending targets consistently could signal the need for better planning.

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) planned to introduce changes to flight duty time limitations (FDTL) to address fatigue in the aviation industry. These changes included more rest time for pilots, redefining night duty, and requiring airlines to report fatigue regularly. However, many Indian airlines, mostly privately owned, opposed these changes, citing concerns about increased costs and flight cancellations. Recently, the DGCA quietly allowed airlines to continue operating under previous regulations until their new schemes are approved. This decision has raised concerns about prioritizing airline economics over safety. The article highlights the importance of managing fatigue in aviation and calls for the DGCA to enforce regulations that prioritize safety for both flight crews and

### [Easily provoked: On India’s internal affairs and foreign comments](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/easily-provoked-indias-internal-affairs-foreign-comments/article68002512.ece)

New Delhi and Washington seem to be at odds over the U.S.'s expressions of concern regarding the actions of the Modi government ahead of the general election. The U.S. State Department commented on the arrest of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal, prompting a stern response from India's Ministry of External Affairs, which summoned the acting Deputy Chief of the U.S. mission in Delhi and criticized U.S. interference in internal affairs. Similar remarks from a German diplomat also received a rebuke. Despite Germany toning down its statements, the U.S. reiterated concerns about legal processes and froze Congress Party accounts during the election campaign, leading to another rebuke. The Modi government may need to reflect on whether these interventions are valid concerns and consider the broader implications for the India-U.S. relationship. Recent incidents, such as the U.S. indictment related to an alleged assassination plot, have strained public engagement, despite strong trade, technology, and military cooperation. The decision by President Biden to decline India's Republic Day invitation and the cancellation of the U.S. NSA's visit, along with the vacancy of the Indian Ambassador to Washington post, warrant examination. India has options to respond to the situation: continue the public spat, reciprocate U.S. comments on internal matters, or refrain from being provoked. Choosing the latter, though less appealing to the government's pugilistic public diplomacy, would demonstrate strength and confidence in India's democratic record on the global stage.

A recent report on youth employment in India highlights concerning trends. Despite a growing labor force, there's a significant proportion of unemployed youth, especially among the educated. The report suggests a lack of job opportunities for educated youth and deficiencies in the quality of education. Additionally, wages have either stagnated or decreased after adjusting for inflation. The window to harness India's demographic dividend is closing, with the youth population projected to decline. Issues such as gender imbalance in the labor force and high rates of informal employment further underscore the need for comprehensive policy interventions. Policymakers must prioritize job creation and education quality to address these challenges, especially in the context of a rapidly evolving economy.

The Genome India Project has sequenced 10,000 Indian genomes, creating a reference human genome for India. This will aid in disease prevention and treatment, particularly for inherited genetic disorders, including heart failure, which is more prevalent in Indians due to a genetic variant in the MYBPC3 protein. While genome sequencing unveils genetic complexity, it also highlights challenges in developing affordable and accessible treatments. The project aims to be inclusive, involving collaborations with scientists, students, and others to enhance understanding and make advancements in the field.

The Enforcement Directorate (ED) has raised questions about potential money laundering related to illegal sand mining in Tamil Nadu. While the Supreme Court has ruled that District Collectors must cooperate with ED investigations, it's unclear if the ED has jurisdiction to assess the losses from uncontrolled mining. The Court acknowledged the ED's authority to summon individuals under PMLA, but the Madras High Court had previously stayed the summonses due to concerns that the investigation was a "fishing expedition." Despite the Supreme Court's assertion that the High Court's reasoning was flawed, some argue that the ED's credibility and possible political bias warrant caution in its actions.

In Rajya Sabha elections, the BJP won 30 of 56 contested seats, surpassing expectations through alleged cross-voting by opposition members in Uttar Pradesh and Himachal Pradesh. Himachal Pradesh's Congress government faces instability after BJP gains from MLAs lost to disqualification. The BJP now has 97 members in the Rajya Sabha, closer to the majority mark. Despite successive state election victories, the party has engaged in controversial tactics to strengthen its position. The gap between the BJP and other opposition parties, including Congress with 29 members, remains significant. Past parliamentary sessions have been marked by opposition suspensions and government unilateralism.

### [A respite: On the Trump case](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/a-respite-on-the-trump-case/article67900199.ece)

The US Supreme Court has agreed to hear arguments in April regarding former President Donald Trump's immunity from federal criminal prosecution for alleged election subversion. The decision delays a trial, likely pushing a ruling until late June. This halts Special Counsel Jack Smith's plans for earlier prosecution. Trump faces other legal challenges, including indictments, which will be affected by the Supreme Court's immunity decision. The prosecution battle highlights political divisions, as the lack of viable alternative leaders makes the 2024 election advantageous for Trump. This situation reflects the current lack of a unifying vision in American politics.

The Statistics Ministry released preliminary findings on February 28th, 2024, from the Household Consumption Expenditure Survey. Although these results provide insights into household-level changes, they should be cautiously interpreted. Conducted every five years, the last survey in 2017-18 was scrapped due to data quality issues. The 2022-23 survey includes data gathered post-pandemic and during a time of high inflation. Urban households' monthly per capita expenditure increased by 33.5% since 2011-12, reaching ₹3,510, while in rural areas, it rose by 40.4% to ₹2,008. Including imputed values from welfare schemes, these figures still remain below the average growth rate. Changes in food spending, with a decrease in the proportion spent on cereals, may influence inflation trends. However, the results may not fully reflect the current state of the economy due to the effects of pent-up demand and inflation. Therefore, recalculations of poverty, inflation, or GDP should wait for the complete findings of the new survey, which concludes in July 2024.

India's human spaceflight mission, Gaganyaan, has finalized its candidate list, with Prasanth Balakrishnan Nair, Ajit Krishnan, Angad Pratap, and Shubhanshu Shukla as potential astronauts. With this announcement, India aims to send an Indian crew to low-earth orbit using an Indian rocket. The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) plans to conduct test flights of the Launch Vehicle Mark-3 rocket in 2024 and 2025, followed by a crewed launch in 2025. While Gaganyaan has faced delays due to the COVID-19 pandemic and ISRO's commercial commitments, it is now nearing its final stages. The article emphasizes the importance of balancing political involvement with scientific exploration and democratic values in space missions. It also highlights the need for India to focus on scientific exploration and societal value rather than geopolitical aspirations and achieving superpower status. Finally, the article acknowledges that India's space program has lagged behind countries like China but emphasizes the importance of maintaining a focus on scientific exploration and expanding human horizons.

The Indian government has achieved 81% of its direct tax collection target for the financial year 2023-24. With direct tax inflows of ₹14.7 lakh crore, economists predict that the total collection will exceed the budget estimate of ₹17.2 lakh crore by around ₹1 lakh crore. Corporate taxes have increased by 12.4%, while personal income taxes have seen a 27.3% rise. This positive revenue growth allows for fiscal consolidation and potential tax reforms to simplify the system for both individuals and corporations. The government may also consider encouraging retirement savings and health insurance to align with public policy goals. Additionally, the 18% GST levy on health insurance and a broader rationalization of GST rates are awaited. Despite no significant moves expected in the upcoming Interim Budget 2024-25, the government should keep reform options on the table for the new government to consider.

Indore, Madhya Pradesh has been declared the cleanest city for the seventh consecutive year, sharing the honor with Surat, Gujarat. The top-ranking cities have shown consistency, while lower-ranked cities experience volatility. The article suggests that the focus on top-performing cities overlooks the challenges faced by other cities and recommends retiring consistent toppers for a few years to highlight these challenges. It also raises concerns about the ranking system's effectiveness in motivating improvements in sanitation.

The article discusses the issue of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) caused by the prophylactic use of antibiotics. A survey conducted in India revealed that over 70% of patients in tertiary-care hospitals were prescribed antibiotics, with over 50% having the potential to cause AMR. Alarmingly, 55% of patients received antibiotics as preventive measures, while only 45% received them to treat infections, and only 6% were prescribed drugs after identifying the specific bacteria. AMR poses a significant threat to global health, making infections harder to treat and increasing the risks associated with medical procedures. Experts emphasize the need for rational prescription of antibiotics, curbs on the use of drugs in animals and plants, and urgent research and development of new antibiotics. Strict regulation of antimicrobial use and funding for antibiotic research are crucial in addressing this issue.

India's quest for a Test series win in South Africa remains unfulfilled. The recent series ended in a 1-1 stalemate, with the second game being the shortest Test ever played. India's victory in that game was overshadowed by their earlier loss in the first Test. The Newlands pitch tested the batting skills of both teams, with erratic bounce and seam movement. The article also highlights the dwindling number of batsmen who can stay long at the crease, with a trend towards a more aggressive approach. India's performance in the T20s and ODIs was more successful, but they are still figuring out their strategies and building blocks for all three formats. The absence of Rishabh Pant forced KL Rahul to take on wicket-keeping duties in Tests, which is not an ideal long-term solution. The article concludes with the disappointment of another South African tour that promised much but yielded little.

The Supreme Court of India has ruled on a batch of petitions related to allegations of malfeasance in the Adani group of companies. The court has deferred to the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) and its investigation, stating that SEBI has conducted a comprehensive investigation and there is no evidence of deliberate inaction or inadequacy. The court did not address concerns about SEBI's handling of the allegations, but directed SEBI to complete the remaining investigations promptly. The ruling has raised questions about the court's reluctance to review SEBI's actions and its impact on the public interest.

The article discusses the provision in the Bharatiya Nyaya Sanhita (BNS) that treats hit-and-run accident cases as a more severe offense. The government is planning to implement this provision after consulting with the All India Motor Transport Congress, as truck drivers are concerned about the implications. The article raises the question of whether there should be an increase in the jail term for accidents from two to five years in all cases, and up to 10 years for failure to report them to the authorities. The article also mentions the need for a comprehensive accident prevention policy package that covers imprisonment, compensation, and safety, rather than solely focusing on raising prison terms.
