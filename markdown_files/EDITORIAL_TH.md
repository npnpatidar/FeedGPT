### [To abide or not: On the Karnataka case and corruption charges](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/to-abide-or-not-the-hindu-editorial-on-the-karnataka-case-and-corruption-charges/article68543330.ece)

The Karnataka Governor's decision to grant permission for prosecution against Chief Minister Siddaramaiah on corruption charges has sparked debate.  The legality of the Governor's action, independent of the Council of Ministers' advice, is questioned. Siddaramaiah contends that the Governor disregarded advice to refuse sanction.  The case revolves around land allotment by the Mysore Urban Development Authority, with allegations of impropriety. 

While the State government supports a judicial inquiry, the Governor deems it insufficient. The Chief Minister denies involvement in the land allocation process, maintaining it occurred during the previous BJP government. The Governor's action highlights the ongoing tension between the executive and the judiciary, and raises concerns about potential selective prosecution.

The selections seem to reflect a shift towards meaningful cinema that resonates with contemporary issues, vindicating the National Awards' original purpose.

The assembly elections in Haryana and Jammu and Kashmir, scheduled from September 18 to October 1, will be closely watched as they test India's democratic processes. The elections, the first for J&K since its reorganization in 2019, are significant as a new government could be a crucial step towards a lasting political solution. 

Security concerns and festivals are cited as reasons for staggered elections, with Maharashtra and Jharkhand polls to be announced later. The outcome will have implications beyond the two states, influencing national politics and signaling the BJP’s electoral strength a year before the general election.

Sri Lanka is holding its ninth presidential election on September 21st with a record 39 candidates. Incumbent President Ranil Wickremesinghe, running as an independent, hopes to leverage the political and economic stability achieved during his tenure.  He faces challenges from Sajith Premadasa of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, Anura Kumara Dissanayake of the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, and Namal Rajapaksa of the SLPP.  The election comes after Sri Lanka faced a severe economic crisis in 2022, prompting a debt restructuring and the ousting of former President Gotabaya Rajapaksa.  The candidates, including representatives of the Aragalaya movement, will seek to address public concerns about the economy and traditional politics.

The World Health Organization (WHO) has declared the mpox outbreak a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC), following a declaration by the Africa CDC as a public health emergency of continental security (PHECS).  This marks the first time a regional and global health emergency has been declared for a disease outbreak in Africa. 

The current outbreak, driven by the more lethal clade 1b virus, has seen 2,863 confirmed cases and 517 deaths primarily in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Concerns remain over vaccine supply, with only 0.21 million doses expected immediately against a need for 10 million.  Doses are currently authorized only in the DRC and Nigeria, highlighting the need for wider authorization and expedited global distribution.

### [Neighbourhood troubles: On India and instability in the region](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/neighbourhood-troubles-on-india-and-instability-in-the-region/article68533413.ece)

Thailand's Parliament elected Paetongtarn Shinawatra, at 37 the country's youngest Prime Minister. This follows the Constitutional Court's ousting of Srettha Thavisin due to ethical violations related to his Cabinet's appointment of someone convicted in a corruption case involving Paetongtarn's father, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra.  

The Shinawatra family has a history of facing court dismissals, highlighting Thailand's political instability. Paetongtarn's path to reform and economic recovery is likely to be challenging due to the conservative establishment's influence and her limited experience. She is expected to rely heavily on her father's guidance.

Prime Minister Modi's Independence Day address emphasized continuity and authority in his third term. He championed a uniform civil code, 'one nation, one election,' and enhanced women's safety. 

Modi criticized attempts to destabilize the economy, echoing the BJP's stance on the Hindenburg Research report. He called for  one lakh first-generation young leaders in politics. Reviewing his previous terms, he highlighted progress in manufacturing and fighting corruption.  The article critiques the government's partisan approach on these issues, noting the lack of consensus building and the targeting of opposition figures in corruption inquiries. It emphasizes the importance of accountability and criticism as essential aspects of a functioning democracy.

### [​Choppy waters: On shrinking exports](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bchoppy-waters-on-shrinking-exports/article68529172.ece)

India's merchandise exports fell 1.5% in July, marking their weakest performance since November 2023. While sectors like electronics, garments, and handicrafts showed growth, declines in petroleum, gems and jewellery, and chemicals hampered overall export performance.  

Imports surged 7.5% due to increased petroleum and consumer demand, leading to a 24% jump in the trade deficit. This was attributed to both a decrease in export growth and a rise in imports. The Commerce Ministry remains optimistic about India surpassing last year's export record, but uncertainties like geopolitical disruptions and weak global demand pose challenges.

### [​Illusory blip: On inflation](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Billusory-blip-on-inflation/article68524975.ece)

India's retail inflation eased to a 3.54% rise in July, its lowest in nearly five years. This slowdown was largely due to a 13-month low in food inflation, reaching 5.4%. While the Consumer Price Index (CPI) aligned with the Reserve Bank of India's target for the first time since August 2019, the MPC expects inflation to rebound later in the year. This is attributed to base effects and the persistence of price pressures in food items like pulses, despite a decline in vegetable inflation. Services inflation also saw a rise, driven by higher transport and communication costs. Though the July figures offer some relief, experts caution against complacency, as Monsoon uncertainties and continued food price pressures may hinder a sustainable decline in inflation.

The brutal rape and murder of a postgraduate medical student in a Kolkata government hospital has sparked national outrage. The incident, highlighting the systemic failures in ensuring safety within hospitals, has revealed a disturbing pattern of violence against healthcare professionals.  Public anger prompted authorities to act after initially attempting to cover up the crime. 

The case echoes previous attacks on doctors, including the murder of Dr. Vandana Das in Kerala and numerous assaults during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrating the urgent need for improved security and legislation to protect healthcare workers. The government must take proactive steps to prevent such tragedies and ensure the safety of those who dedicate their lives to saving others.

The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) is facing allegations of bias and conflict of interest concerning its Chairperson, Madhabi Puri Buch.  Hindenburg Research claims Ms. Buch and her husband made investments in offshore funds where Adani Group's Vinod Adani also invested, while their consultancy firms in Singapore and India potentially advised SEBI-regulated clients.  Ms. Buch claims her consultancy firms were inactive since her SEBI appointment, but Hindenburg disputes this, citing revenue figures. This unprecedented situation raises concerns about SEBI's impartiality in its ongoing investigation into the Adani Group for alleged stock market manipulation.  

The integrity of India's securities regulator is at stake,  leading to calls for Ms. Buch's resignation to allow for a thorough investigation.

India's performance at the Paris Olympics fell short of expectations, securing one silver and five bronze medals, a decline from the previous Games. While new stars emerged in shooting and wrestling, the country's reliance on a few athletes was evident.  The lack of representation in disciplines like swimming and gymnastics, coupled with wrestler Vinesh Phogat's disqualification, highlighted areas for improvement.  Broadening the sport's base, increasing participation, and ensuring equitable funding distribution are crucial for future success.

The Election Commission of India's recent visit to Jammu and Kashmir signals a push for assembly elections in the Union Territory.  The Supreme Court has directed the ECI to hold elections by September 30, 2024, emphasizing that direct elections cannot be delayed until statehood is restored.  J&K's last Assembly election was in 2014,  and the region has been under central rule since 2019. The Centre is encouraged by the high voter turnout in the recent Lok Sabha elections, indicating a possible receptiveness to democratic processes. Holding Assembly elections is seen as a vital step towards restoring normalcy, addressing pressing issues like unemployment and infrastructure, and fostering healing in the region.

The Zika virus outbreak in Maharashtra, with 88 confirmed cases as of early August, has raised concerns, particularly regarding pregnant women. Although rare, Zika can cause Guillain-Barré syndrome and poses a significant risk to fetuses, potentially leading to microcephaly and neurological impairments. Studies have shown a substantial risk of birth defects and complications associated with Zika infection during pregnancy.  The virus can also be transmitted sexually by infected men for at least two months, highlighting the need for awareness and preventive measures.  

The slow response in initiating testing capacity in Pune underscores the importance of robust and decentralized testing infrastructure, as demonstrated by the effectiveness of such systems during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Nipah virus outbreak in Kerala. Prompt testing and sequencing of potential pathogens are crucial for effective public health interventions and containing outbreaks.

The Supreme Court's bail grant to Delhi Deputy CM Manish Sisodia emphasizes that bail should not be denied as punishment. Bail is generally granted in cases primarily based on documentary evidence, unless there's a flight risk, witness tampering, or significant trial delay. The court's order highlights the importance of speedy trials and cautions against judges "playing safe" by denying bail routinely.  Sisodia's case, involving prolonged detention and alleged political targeting, underscores the need for the judiciary to protect citizens' liberty and ensure fair trials without unnecessary pre-trial imprisonment. The court's emphasis on time-bound completion of trials is a crucial safeguard in situations where investigations are perceived to be politically motivated.

The Rashtriya Vigyan Puraskar (RVP) replaces the Shanti Swarup Bhatnagar (SSB) awards for scientists under 45. The new award scheme includes the Vigyan Shri, Vigyan Ratna and Vigyan Team awards, with a cap of 56 total awards across categories.  While the RVP aims to streamline and elevate scientific recognition in India, emphasizing both individual and team achievements, some critics argue the awards should prioritize improved funding and infrastructure for research.  The list of awardees primarily represents scientists from elite institutions, highlighting the existing disparities in access to resources within the scientific community.

Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, head of Bangladesh's interim government, has called for calm amidst widespread violence and unrest following former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation. Clashes between political parties and extremist groups have targeted religious minorities and Awami League supporters. Yunus, chosen for his perceived neutrality, faces the challenge of restoring order, preventing military intervention, and facilitating peaceful elections. Building a temporary truce between political rivals, notably the Jamaat and BNP, is crucial, along with ensuring free and fair elections to regain public trust and stability. The success of Bangladesh's current transition hinges on addressing these critical challenges.

The Reserve Bank of India's Monetary Policy Committee has maintained its benchmark interest rates for the ninth consecutive meeting. This decision stems from ongoing concerns about persistently high inflation, which has exceeded the targeted 4% for an extended period, impacting consumer confidence. 

Governor Shaktikanta Das emphasized the threat posed by elevated food prices, particularly given their significant weight in the Consumer Price Index and direct impact on household budgets.  Although vegetable prices had shown some softening in June, the MPC anticipates continued pressure on inflation, potentially extending into the festive season. The committee raised its inflation projections for the remaining fiscal year, signaling a less optimistic outlook.

They highlighted the risks of spillovers from food prices to other goods and services, as well as potential inflationary effects from mobile tariff revisions. The MPC reiterated the crucial link between price stability and sustainable economic growth.

Vinesh Phogat's Olympic journey ended in heartbreak when she was found 100 grams overweight before her final bout in the women's 50kg category. Despite weighing in successfully the previous day, she gained weight overnight. Desperate attempts to shed the extra kilos proved futile. Though Vinesh had triumphed over reigning champion Yui Susaki and Cuban wrestler Yusneylis Guzman Lopez, the Unified World Wrestling's strict rules resulted in her elimination.  Her performance was seen as a symbol of resilience, particularly in light of the sexual harassment allegations against former Wrestling Federation of India chief Brij Bhushan Sharan Singh, which the Indian contingent faced.  Vinesh's exit, leaving her without a medal despite her extraordinary efforts, has deeply saddened Indian sports fans.

A U.S. court ruled that Google is a monopoly, finding that it violated antitrust laws by using exclusive deals with smartphone manufacturers to maintain its dominance in the online search market. Judge Amit P. Mehta stated that Google's practices stifled competition. 

The Department of Justice is now considering potential remedies, which could range from breaking up Google to eliminating its exclusive agreements with phone makers like Apple and Samsung. These decisions have significant implications for the future of Big Tech, as similar antitrust cases are pending against companies like Meta, Amazon, and Apple.

The Supreme Court ruled that the Lt. Governor of Delhi holds independent authority in appointing aldermen to the Delhi Municipal Corporation. This decision, based on the law governing Centre-Delhi relations and previous judgments, underscores the Delhi government's vulnerability to central influence. 

The Court clarified that the Lt. Governor's power to appoint individuals with special knowledge in municipal administration isn't subject to the advice of the Delhi Council of Ministers. This power, rooted in the Delhi Municipal Corporation Act, stands apart from the general rule that the Lt. Governor acts on the advice of the Council of Ministers on most matters. This ruling highlights the potential for conflict between the elected government and the appointed administrator. 

While the Constitution Bench attempted to establish a framework for resolving disagreements, the Centre ultimately retains the final say in Delhi's governance due to Parliament's power to legislate and amend laws pertaining to matters under the Delhi Assembly's jurisdiction.

Puja Khedkar's case exposes a deeply flawed system within the Union Public Service Commission recruitment process.  Khedkar used multiple deceptions, including faking a disability and community certificate, to secure a position she wouldn't have otherwise obtained. Her actions highlight a systemic vulnerability where impersonation and manipulation can easily undermine the fairness of competitive examinations.  The government must address this by overhauling the entire examination system, ensuring robust measures to detect fraud and protect the integrity of the process.  This incident also raises concerns about the disability certification process, demanding a review to safeguard genuine applicants and prevent exploitation.

Sheikh Hasina, ousted Prime Minister of Bangladesh, narrowly escaped mob violence following months of student protests.  A once beloved leader credited with economic progress and fighting terrorism, Hasina faced growing resentment over alleged vote rigging, suppression of dissent, and politically motivated arrests. 

The student protests, triggered by quota system issues, ignited a wider anger stemming from years of curtailing democratic processes. Hasina's hardline approach alienated even those who had previously supported her, including Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus.

Hasina’s forced exit raises concerns about the potential influence of Islamist groups and the future of Bangladesh’s secularism.

After President Biden's unexpected withdrawal from the race, Vice President Kamala Harris is the Democratic nominee to challenge former President Donald Trump in the November election. Harris, who secured a majority of party votes, has chosen Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as her running mate.  Despite her late entry, she has gained a slight lead in national polls and raised a significant amount of campaign funds. 

The Trump campaign, having previously focused its attacks on Biden, is now pivoting to criticize Harris, resorting to disparaging language and questioning her racial identity. This strategy may inadvertently benefit Harris, allowing her to appeal to a broader electorate and potentially construct a more inclusive policy agenda. The world, seeking stability and democratic values, will be watching closely as the election unfolds.

The assassinations of Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr in Beirut and Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran have significantly escalated tensions in the West Asia region. While Israel claims responsibility for Shukr's death, it hasn't confirmed its involvement in Haniyeh's killing. These incidents follow the already tense situation along Israel's northern border with Lebanon, leading to rocket exchanges between Hezbollah and the Israeli Defense Forces. The killings raise concerns about Iranian retaliation against Israel, potentially triggering a larger conflict.  Haniyeh's death is particularly concerning as he was a moderate voice within Hamas and was involved in ceasefire negotiations with Israel.  Israel's actions, seen as blatant provocations, risk drawing the US into a regional war.

Manu Bhaker's historic bronze medal wins in the 10m air pistol and mixed 10m air pistol events at the Paris Olympics marked a resurgence for Indian shooting. Bhaker's success followed a period of drought in the sport after a string of medals in previous Olympic Games. 

Her achievements highlight the progress made in Indian shooting, building upon the early pioneering efforts of shooters like Anjali Bhagwat and Suma Shirur. The support system, including coaching from experienced figures like Jaspal Rana, has played a crucial role in nurturing young talent. Bhaker's performance, along with Swapnil Kusale's bronze and Arjun Babuta's fourth-place finish, demonstrated the capability of Indian shooters on the world stage.

India's core infrastructure sectors saw growth slow to a 20-month low of 4% in June.  

This slowdown was attributed to reduced state spending on public works following the general election and persistent heatwaves that dampened economic activity. Sectors like refinery products, electricity generation, and steel experienced contractions or significant decelerations in growth. However, coal production expanded at a robust pace. 

A private survey indicated that broader manufacturing activity eased slightly in July, but input costs surged, prompting manufacturers to raise selling prices at their fastest rate in over a decade, raising concerns about inflationary pressures.

Amendments to Uttar Pradesh's anti-conversion law aim to increase jail terms for those convicted of "unlawful conversion."  The law, originally enacted in 2021, has been used to prosecute over 400 cases primarily concerning inter-faith marriages. 

The amended law includes harsher bail provisions,  similar to those in the NDPS and PMLA Acts, and expands the possibility of filing a complaint against alleged conversions to anyone, not just the victim or their family. This raises concerns about misuse by communal organizations targeting interfaith relationships.  Critics argue the law criminalizes interfaith marriages and violates fundamental rights.

The Supreme Court has ruled that Scheduled Castes (SCs) can be sub-classified to provide preferential treatment to weaker sections. This decision overturns a 2005 judgment that prohibited states from modifying the SC list. 

The court acknowledged the diversity within SCs and recognized that historical and social disadvantages vary. States can now identify and grant benefits to the most backward groups within SCs. The verdict also addressed the "creamy layer" concept, suggesting its potential application to SCs, although specific norms remain to be determined. The focus remains on ensuring adequate representation for the most marginalized Dalit communities.

Nicolas Maduro won Venezuela's recent presidential election with 51% of the vote, extending his rule for another six years. However, the opposition, claiming widespread irregularities and a stolen vote, reports their candidate Edmundo González won by a significant margin. 

Anti-Maduro protests erupted following the official results which the opposition rejects. Maduro's victory comes amidst a devastating economic crisis that has seen Venezuela's economy contract by 80% in a decade, with extreme poverty and household poverty reaching 53% and 82% respectively.  

The crisis is attributed to factors including falling oil prices, sanctions, and Maduro's policies. Despite the opposition's allegations, Maduro has denied fraud. The US and some Latin American allies have called for transparency but Maduro still enjoys military support.

The Ministry of Information and Broadcasting has reportedly withheld the latest draft of the Broadcasting Services (Regulation) Bill, 2023, from public consultation. While an earlier draft was circulated publicly, the current version is only being shared with select stakeholders under confidentiality agreements. This approach raises concerns as it excludes online creators, parts of the media industry, and civil society, who are heavily impacted by media regulations. The Bill potentially strengthens an existing regulatory framework already criticized for discouraging free expression. The lack of transparency and limited stakeholder engagement raises questions about the government's intent and the potential for the Bill to be exclusionary and flawed.

The Supreme Court of India delivered a split verdict on the approval of genetically modified (GM) mustard, DMH-11. While Justice Nagarathna found the Genetic Engineering Appraisal Committee (GEAC)'s approval violated the precautionary principle, Justice Karol supported the GEAC's process. 

The case, which arose from a dispute between developers and environmentalists over the crop's potential environmental impact, will now be heard by a larger Bench. Notably, the Court ordered the government to formulate a comprehensive policy on GM crops.  This highlights the ongoing debate surrounding GM technology in India, which is influenced by both scientific and ideological considerations.

Deadly landslides in Kerala's Wayanad district, triggered by heavy monsoon rains, have claimed over 200 lives. While landslides are common during this season, their intensity and fatalities are unprecedented. Contributing factors include exacerbated river flow due to deforestation and weakened upstream soil stability from previous heavy rains. 

The tragedy highlights the compounding effects of climate change and inadequate disaster preparedness.  The state's vulnerability to landslides in ecologically sensitive areas, exacerbated by excessive rain and development, necessitates a shift in land use practices and increased environmental protection measures.  Failure to heed warnings and implement proper measures risks more devastating consequences in the future.

The Indian government aims to collaborate with the private sector to explore small modular reactors (SMRs) as a potential source of nuclear energy. SMRs are smaller, potentially safer, and more cost-effective than traditional reactors. 

However, challenges remain in ensuring the commercial viability of SMRs, including addressing proliferation concerns and managing the significant amount of plutonium produced. 

The success of SMRs in India will depend on factors such as stable grids, market conditions, mass production capabilities, and the cost of safety and proliferation measures.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Certain Governors have been sending Bills passed by State legislatures to the President for consideration, bypassing the assembly's legislative power. This raises concerns about the misuse of the provision for reservation of Bills, as it gives the Centre, acting through the President, a veto over State laws—a power not explicitly granted in the Constitution.  Kerala has challenged this practice in court, arguing it undermines federalism.  

The Supreme Court had previously ruled that Governors do not have a veto and must act on Bills promptly. However, some Governors, including those in West Bengal and Kerala, continue to bypass the assembly, delaying legislation for months and even refusing assent without justification.  The court's intervention is crucial to clarify the limits of a Governor's power and ensure the constitutional balance between the Centre and States.
=======
The article discusses the controversial actions of some Governors in handling legislation passed by state legislatures. Following Supreme Court interventions in Punjab, Tamil Nadu, and Telangana, Governors have increasingly sent disapproved Bills to the President for consideration, bypassing the state legislatures.  

This practice raises concerns about the misuse of the provision for presidential assent, effectively giving the Centre a veiled veto over state laws, something not intended by the Constitution. Kerala's legal challenge against the Governor's actions in this regard highlights the potential subversion of federalism. 


The article emphasizes the Supreme Court's prior rulings in the Punjab and Telangana cases, where the court clarified the Governor's limited power and obligation to act promptly on Bills.  Despite these rulings,  the Governors of West Bengal and Kerala continue to send Bills to the President, raising questions about their adherence to constitutional principles.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The recent Union Budget marked a significant shift in focus towards tackling India's employment crisis. A ₹2 lakh crore package was announced, aiming to assist 4.1 crore youth over five years. The package includes three employment-linked incentive schemes,  upgraded industrial training institutes aligned with industry demands, and a large-scale internship program. 

Acknowledging the crisis highlights a key concern raised by the opposition, particularly in light of vulnerabilities within the informal sector.  While the government's focus on boosting private investment through production incentives is commendable, critics argue that it falls short of directly addressing job creation. The success of this initiative depends on factors like private sector growth and consumption patterns.

The recent Union Budget prioritizes employment, with a ₹2 lakh crore package aimed at supporting 4.1 crore youth.  

This includes three incentive schemes encouraging hiring of fresh entrants and incentives for companies to scale up their workforce. The government also plans to revamp 1,000 industrial training institutes and launch a large-scale internship program. The focus on tackling unemployment acknowledges a significant concern highlighted by the Opposition. This initiative aims to address the issue of jobless growth, partly caused by investor preference for capital-intensive investments and outdated labor laws.  Success will require more government action, including filling existing vacancies and stimulating consumption, crucial for private sector growth and hiring.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The recent IAS coaching center flooding incident in Delhi highlights the increasing problem of urban flooding, often exacerbated by human errors. Building regulations generally prohibit residential use of basements, but mixed-use buildings sometimes exploit them for income generation. 

The Delhi Master Plan mandates clearances from authorities for basement use in coaching centers, but enforcement remains lax.  The incident raises concerns about permit renewals, bribe demands, and insufficient flood resilience measures.  The article underscores the need for stringent implementation of building codes, including flood-resistant features, to prevent future tragedies.
=======
The fatal flooding at an IAS coaching centre in New Delhi highlights the increasing risk of localized urban flooding, often caused by human error.  Basements in buildings, particularly those without proper ventilation and access, are particularly vulnerable. While Indian building bylaws generally prohibit habitation in basements, they are often used for other purposes, such as offices or classrooms, due to rising land and building costs. The Delhi Master Plan 2021 mandates clearance from fire authorities for basement use in coaching centres, but it remains unclear if the affected centre obtained the necessary permissions. The incident raises concerns about poor civic infrastructure and enforcement of building regulations.  


Resilient building design, including flood barriers and non-return valves, can mitigate these risks.

A rocket attack on a football ground in the Golan Heights, killing 12 young people, has escalated tensions between Israel and Hezbollah. While Hezbollah initially claimed to have targeted Israeli military outposts, they later denied involvement, a claim Israel dismisses. This incident follows a slow-burning war on Israel's northern border since Hamas's attack in October 2023. Both sides have engaged in escalating violence, with Hezbollah launching rocket attacks from Lebanon and Israel retaliating with airstrikes.  

The current situation risks spiraling into a wider conflict, with Hezbollah's strengthened military capabilities and potential Iranian involvement posing a significant threat.  Ending hostilities and de-escalating the situation is crucial to prevent further bloodshed and achieve lasting peace.

A rocket attack on a football ground in Majdal Shams, resulting in the death of 12 young people, has heightened tensions in the region. Israel and the U.S. accuse Hezbollah of the attack, though the group denies involvement. This incident follows on from a series of rocket attacks by Hezbollah from southern Lebanon, targeting Israeli military outposts, in response to the October 2023 Hamas attack on Israel.  Both sides, while cautious initially,  are now on alert. This escalation risks wider conflict, potentially drawing in Iran, given Hezbollah's strong ties with Iran.  A 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah resulted in significant damage for Israel. Both sides need to de-escalate tensions and prioritize peace, starting with an end to the conflict in Gaza.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The boycott of the NITI Aayog meeting by several states has raised concerns about the think tank's effectiveness and its role in "cooperative federalism".  Chief Ministers allege  a lack of allocations and projects for their states in the Union Budget, highlighting the absence of resource distribution powers for NITI Aayog.  

The shift from the Planning Commission to NITI Aayog has seemingly created "competitive federalism", with states feeling sidelined in crucial financial decisions.  The government's focus on "double engine" governance, which favors BJP-ruled states, further exacerbates this perception. 

Critics argue that the NITI Aayog needs to be re-imagined to restore some of the Planning Commission's functions to truly facilitate collaborative federalism.
=======
The 9th Governing Council meeting of the NITI Aayog saw seven Chief Ministers boycott the event, protesting the perceived lack of allocations and projects for their States in the Union Budget. This, along with West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee’s walkout, raises concerns about NITI Aayog’s effectiveness and its transition from the Planning Commission. 

Critics argue that by relegating itself to an advisory body without resource allocation powers, NITI Aayog has fostered "competitive federalism" and limited consultations with States on grants and projects. Furthermore, the BJP's "double engine" slogan during elections, emphasizing investments in BJP-ruled States, has exacerbated these concerns. The NITI Aayog is urged to regain some of the Planning Commission's responsibilities concerning States to achieve a more cooperative federalism.

India generates a massive amount of plastic waste annually, with only a fraction recycled. The EPR system, aiming to hold producers responsible for their plastic waste, relies on certificates issued to recyclers.  

Fraudulent certificates and cybersecurity breaches have plagued the system, casting doubt on the effectiveness of recycling efforts.  

To address this, the CPCB has initiated audits of recyclers and strengthened the EPR platform's security. Despite these measures, concerns remain regarding the system's long-term sustainability and the need to reduce plastic production. True progress requires a multi-faceted approach that tackles both waste management and the root causes of plastic pollution.
=======
India faces a massive plastic waste problem, generating 4 million tonnes annually. While the Plastic Waste Management Rules mandate recycling through an extended producer responsibility (EPR) system, issues with fraud and security threats have emerged.   

The EPR system, involving certificates for recycled plastic, saw an estimated 3.7 million tonnes claimed in 2022-23, but  600,000 certificates were identified as fraudulent. To address this, the CPCB is auditing registered recyclers and improving the platform's security. While necessary, such audits should be infrequent to maintain trust in the system. The effectiveness of EPR alone is limited, highlighting the need to reduce plastic production and promote sustainable alternatives. Tackling the root causes of plastic waste and strengthening recycling infrastructure are crucial for India to manage its plastic pollution effectively.

Ahead of Prime Minister Netanyahu's U.S. visit, the IDF issued an evacuation order for Palestinians in Khan Younis, furthering the humanitarian crisis in Gaza.  Over 39,000 Palestinians have died in the ongoing conflict, with tens of thousands wounded and nearly the entire population displaced. 

Despite international condemnation and UN warnings of epidemics, the U.S. continues to provide military support to Israel. While the Biden administration expresses concern over civilian casualties, concrete action remains limited.  Mr Netanyahu's congressional address was met with applause, highlighting the support of U.S. elites, but simultaneous protests indicate a growing public dissent towards the war and U.S. involvement.

The Supreme Court has ruled that States have the power to tax mineral rights and mineral-bearing lands, overturning a long-held belief that this power was limited by Parliament's Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act of 1957.  

The Court found that the Act does not restrict States' taxation powers and that royalty payments are not considered taxes but contractual considerations. This decision strengthens fiscal federalism and provides States with a new avenue for revenue generation. While the ruling is welcomed by proponents of State autonomy, Justice Nagarathna dissented, expressing concern that it could lead to unhealthy competition among States, potentially increasing mineral costs and impacting the national market.

The court determined that the 1957 Act's royalty provisions are not taxes but contractual considerations. This decision significantly expands states' revenue-generating potential and strengthens their fiscal autonomy.  

However, dissenting Justice B.V. Nagarathna raised concerns about potential negative consequences, including state-level competition, price volatility, and exploitation of the national market.

Andhra Pradesh, seeking ₹1 lakh crore, received ₹15,000 crore for developing its new capital, Amaravati, while Bihar received nearly ₹59,000 crore for infrastructure projects like roads, a power plant, and irrigation.  While acknowledging the need to address the fiscal challenges faced by these states, critics argue that neglecting infrastructure spending in opposition-ruled states like Tamil Nadu and Kerala risks hindering development in these economically advanced regions.

Violent student protests in Bangladesh over the reintroduction of a controversial job quota system have resulted in at least 163 deaths. The protests, triggered by a High Court decision reinstating reservations for specific groups, were met with harsh responses from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government.  

The crisis escalated as the government labeled protesters as collaborators with the Pakistani military during the 1971 Liberation War, leading to accusations of attacks by pro-government forces. The Supreme Court has since scaled back the quota system, making significant concessions to the protesters.  Despite the partial victory, the incident highlights the fragility of civil society-state relations in Bangladesh and the growing youth unemployment crisis which fuelled the unrest.  The government's handling of the situation has been criticized, with calls for accountability and a lasting solution through dialogue and reform.
=======
Violent protests in Bangladesh against its contentious job quota system, which led to 163 deaths, highlighted the strain on the relationship between the government and civil society. Though triggered by a High Court ruling to reinstate the old quota system, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's response exacerbated the situation.  She labelled protesters as "Razakars," an offensive term associated with collaborators during the 1971 war, and allegedly tolerated attacks on them by her party’s student wing.  

The Supreme Court eventually reduced the quota, providing a victory for the protesters.   fuelled by both economic hardship and political discontent.  Government jobs are highly sought after given high youth unemployment, and the quota system is seen as benefiting the ruling Awami League.  


  The situation emphasizes the need for the government to engage in dialogue with protesters and opposition leaders to find lasting solutions, investigate the deaths, and address Bangladesh's unemployment crisis.

The Karnataka government's draft Bill proposing reservation in jobs for local candidates has raised concerns about its constitutionality. Similar Bills passed in other states, like Haryana and Andhra Pradesh, have faced legal challenges due to their violation of equality and freedom of movement guaranteed by the Constitution. These laws create artificial barriers to employment and are seen as protectionist policies.  The Karnataka Bill, which attempts to define "local" based on residency and Kannada proficiency, also faces challenges under Article 16(3) of the Constitution, which restricts reservation based on residence to public employment and mandates Parliamentary legislation. Instead of resorting to such divisive measures, the government should focus on enforcing labor rights for all workers, including migrant workers, to ensure a level playing field and address concerns about exploitation.
=======
The Karnataka government's draft bill proposing local reservation in industries sparked controversy and was later withdrawn.  Despite prior court rulings deeming such attempts unconstitutional, the bill aimed to reserve 50% of management and 70% of non-management positions for local candidates.  

This move was criticized for violating fundamental rights and creating artificial barriers to employment based on residency.

Similar laws in Haryana and Andhra Pradesh have also faced legal challenges, with the Haryana law being quashed by the Punjab and Haryana High Court.  The Karnataka government's intent, possibly driven by resident worker resentment towards migrant workers, overlooks the potential for ensuring equal labor rights and protections for all workers, instead of resorting to protectionist measures.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Donald Trump's strong showing at the Republican National Convention solidified his expected nomination for the 2024 US presidential election. The event, a first in-person gathering since the COVID-19 pandemic, saw Trump deliver his first public remarks since a recent assassination attempt. Republican strategists emphasized the role of women, featuring figures like Melania Trump,  Lara Trump, Sarah Sanders, and Usha Chilukuri Vance. Trump's choice of  39-year-old  J.D.  Vance as his running mate signals a strategy to appeal to younger voters, while also resonating with white, male America and strengthening his campaign's presence in key Rust Belt states. Although polls currently favor Trump, the race remains fluid with three months until the election.
=======
The Republican National Convention, held for the first time in person since 2020, solidified former President Donald Trump's control over the party. 

Trump, recovering from a recent assassination attempt, delivered his first public speech since the incident.  The convention featured a noticeable emphasis on female political power, a potential strategy to counter Trump's past controversies regarding women. Trump's selection of 39-year-old J.D. Vance as his running mate is seen as an attempt to appeal to younger voters, white male America, and secure support in crucial swing states of the Rust Belt. 

While Trump holds a strong lead in national polls, the presidential race still has three months to unfold.

The Maharashtra government's proposed Bill to combat left-wing extremism has drawn criticism for being unnecessary and potentially unconstitutional.  Critics argue that existing laws are sufficient to tackle the limited issue of left-wing extremism in the state. They express concern that the Bill's overbroad definitions, including the questionable term "urban Naxal," could be used to target lawyers, activists, and dissenters. Provisions allowing for the declaration of organizations as unlawful and criminalizing membership or assistance raise alarm about potential suppression of legitimate dissent and organized protests. The Bill's draconian measures, such as the seizure of property and eviction of occupants, further fuel concerns about its potential for abuse.

A recently tabled Maharashtra bill aimed at combating left-wing extremism raises concerns about its necessity and constitutionality. Critics argue that existing laws are sufficient to address this limited issue within the state.  

The bill's vaguely defined terms, such as "urban Naxal" and "unlawful activity," could be used to target lawful dissent, lawyers, and human rights activists. Provisions allowing for the declaration of organizations as unlawful and for severe penalties against members and supporters raise alarm bells.  

The bill's power to seize assets and evict occupants from buildings associated with alleged unlawful activity further amplifies these concerns, potentially violating individual rights.

<<<<<<< HEAD
India's goods exports grew for the third consecutive month in June, reaching $35.2 billion, while imports rose 5% to $56.2 billion. This resulted in a trade deficit of $21 billion, a 9.4% increase from June 2023.  

Although the oil deficit narrowed slightly to $10 billion, a drop in petroleum exports and a surge in imports indicate domestic demand concerns. Gold imports fell significantly, while silver imports witnessed a sharp increase.  Gems and jewellery exports continued their decline.  

Overall, the import bill excluding oil and gold saw a 3% increase year-on-year, suggesting a recovery in domestic demand. The government is urged to focus on boosting exports and addressing disruptions in the bullion market. A revival in global demand and anticipated interest rate cuts offer opportunities for Indian exporters.

India's June goods exports reached $35.2 billion, marking the third consecutive month of growth. Imports, though up 5% at $56.2 billion, were lower than May's peak. The trade deficit widened 9.4% year-on-year. A significant concern remains the oil deficit, which narrowed to $10 billion but still represents almost half of the first quarter trade deficit. While gold imports fell, silver imports surged.  Gems and jewellery exports continued their decline. The government is urged to address the bullion market disruptions and the export slump in this sector.

The Supreme Court of India has raised concerns about personal liberty in the context of the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA).  The Court questioned the necessity for arresting individuals under the PMLA, highlighting the need for officers to demonstrate justifiable reasons for arrest. 

They also expressed concern over the frequent stays granted by higher courts on reasoned bail orders, emphasizing that such actions should be exceptions rather than routine practice. The Court underlined the importance of statutory compliance and judicial scrutiny in arrest decisions under the PMLA, stressing that arrests should not be arbitrary and should consider both incriminating and exonerating evidence.

Two Supreme Court observations regarding arrests under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) highlight concerns about personal liberty. 

The court questioned whether arresting officers under PMLA must demonstrate the necessity for an arrest, as the law only requires "reason to believe" the person is guilty. It emphasized that arrests should not be arbitrary and that officers must consider both incriminating and exonerating evidence. 

The court also expressed concern over the frequent staying of bail orders granted by lower courts, urging higher courts to be cautious about interfering with reasoned decisions and only intervene in exceptional cases.

Studies highlight the severity of the issue, with stagnant manufacturing employment, slow transition from agriculture, and inadequate job creation rates.  Policy recommendations include a robot tax to incentivize job creation,  revival of the Indian Labour Conference, and increased public investment in agriculture.

<<<<<<< HEAD
India's Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation unexpectedly accelerated to 5.08% in June, driven by a spike in food prices.  Year-on-year food price inflation jumped to 9.36%, primarily due to a 29.3% surge in vegetable prices and sharp increases in potatoes, onions, and tomatoes.  This uptick in food prices, marked by the fastest sequential acceleration in 11 months, has raised concerns for monetary policymakers as rising food prices can ripple through the wider economy.  The situation is further complicated by deficient rainfall in key agricultural regions, including Punjab, which could impact future food production and prices.

India's consumer inflation unexpectedly accelerated to 5.08% in June, driven primarily by a surge in food prices. The Consumer Food Price Index (CFPI) rose 9.36% year-on-year, with eight of its nine sub-categories showing sequential price increases.  

Vegetables, driven by high prices for potatoes, onions, and tomatoes, experienced the most significant price gains. The outlook for food prices remains uncertain, with continued high prices for key staples like rice and wheat, and a monsoon deficit in some key food-growing regions, including Punjab. This volatile food price situation poses a challenge for monetary policymakers attempting to control inflation.

Carlos Alcaraz's victory over Novak Djokovic at Wimbledon marks a significant shift in the tennis landscape. The win solidifies Alcaraz's positioning as the new king of the sport, especially as it's his second consecutive win against Djokovic.

In a predictable development, Nepal Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal lost a trust vote after his Communist Party withdrew support, triggering a coalition shift.  Khadka Prasad Oli of the Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) now returns as Prime Minister, forming a government with Sher Bahadur Deuba's Nepali Congress. This power realignment mirrors Nepal's history of unstable coalition governments focused on maintaining power rather than principled leadership. 

This instability, rooted in the pursuit of power over ideology, has hindered progress and left Nepal struggling, despite post-monarchy reforms.  The author suggests a presidential system as a potential solution to address the chronic political instability.

Nepal's Prime Minister Pushpa Kamal Dahal lost a trust vote, marking yet another shift in the country's volatile political landscape. Dahal's Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist Centre) had formed the government after the 2022 elections despite finishing third, relying on alliances that constantly shifted. The Communist Party of Nepal (Unified Marxist-Leninist) led by Khadka Prasad Oli withdrew support, joining forces with the Nepali Congress to install Oli as the new Prime Minister in a power-sharing arrangement with Sher Bahadur Deuba.  This instability has plagued Nepal since its transition to democracy, leading to poor governance and hindering progress despite constitutional reforms.  The pursuit of power appears to drive coalition politics more than ideology, leaving the Nepali people disillusioned with the democratic process.

The visit resulted in reaffirmation of the India-Russia relationship and an economic target of $100 billion in trade by 2030. Modi also secured assurances for the return of Indian recruits serving in the Russian army. Notably, the visit lacked announcements of new military purchases, possibly due to logistical delays and international concerns.

Prime Minister Modi's visit to Russia, his first since the Ukraine war, was framed as a bilateral effort despite attracting global attention.

While the Karnataka Platform-based Gig Workers (Social Security and Welfare) Bill, 2024, offers a positive step towards addressing this issue, it stops short of granting gig workers the status of employees.  

The bill aims to prevent arbitrary dismissals, establish grievance redress mechanisms, and provide social security through a welfare board funded by the government and platforms.  Advocates highlight the need for mandatory registration to ensure worker visibility and call for a transaction-based welfare fee to ensure sufficient funding.  The bill's swift implementation is crucial, given the precarious situation of gig workers and the lackluster track record of similar initiatives in other states.

The ambush, coupled with a previous attack on pilgrims in June, marks a concerning upsurge in violence after a period of relative calm. This new wave is attributed to various factors, including troop redeployment to the Ladakh border, the use of advanced technology by terrorists, and the push to involve local militants.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Russia's missile strikes on June 8, 2023, which killed at least 42 civilians, including at least two in a Kyiv children's hospital, highlight the brutality of the ongoing invasion. While Russia claims to have targeted military objectives, the extensive civilian casualties raise serious doubts about their intentions. The attack coincided with a NATO summit where member countries are considering long-term support for Ukraine, including substantial military aid. Despite Russia making incremental territorial gains, their progress has been slow, and Ukraine has actively engaged in drone attacks against Russian targets, including ships and energy facilities. 

With no clear military solution in sight, calls for dialogue are intensifying. China and India both expressed support for talks, urging Russia to cease its attacks and enter serious negotiations.
=======
On June 8, Russia launched missile strikes across Ukraine, killing at least 42 civilians, including two at the Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospital in Kyiv. Russia claims the strikes targeted military infrastructure, but such claims are dubious given the pattern of attacks on civilian areas. This attack, taking place ahead of a NATO summit, may have been a message to NATO and Poland, which recently signed a security pact with Ukraine.

While Russia has made incremental territorial gains, its  performance raises questions about its capabilities.  Meanwhile, Ukraine has escalated drone warfare, targeting Russian infrastructure and ships.

The war shows no signs of a military solution.  Both sides should engage in serious dialogue, as urged by world leaders like Xi Jinping and Prime Minister Modi.

After a decade of tension, the Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have proposed a three-tier mechanism to resolve outstanding issues since the state's formation. 

This collaborative approach aims to address disputes concerning water sharing, asset distribution, and the return of villages. The tiers involve committees of officials, ministers, and finally, the Chief Ministers themselves, escalating as necessary. This move signals a positive shift towards cooperation and conflict resolution, benefiting the intertwined economies and communities of both states.

The Chief Ministers of Andhra Pradesh and Telangana have taken a positive step towards resolving long-standing issues between the two states.  A three-tier mechanism has been proposed, starting with a committee of administrative officials, followed by a ministerial committee, and finally, intervention by the Chief Ministers.  This move is seen as a departure from the acrimonious relationship that marked the initial years after Telangana's formation, with both leaders committed to prioritizing the well-being of their people. The agreement signifies a renewed focus on cooperation, particularly in areas such as water sharing, asset distribution, and power supply.

France's New Popular Front, a coalition of left-wing parties, emerged as the largest bloc in the recent snap election, securing 182 seats. Emmanuel Macron's centrist alliance came second with 168 seats, while Marine Le Pen's far-right National Rally secured 143 seats, exceeding expectations.  

The results signify a blow to Macron's political agenda and illustrate rising concerns about the far-right across Europe. The National Rally, led by Jordan Bardella, has adopted a strategy of revising its public image, potentially softening its stance on contentious issues like immigration.  

This shift in public perception has allowed the far-right to gain traction in countries like Italy, Finland, and the Netherlands, posing a significant challenge to the traditional political landscape.

Iran's recent presidential election, necessitated by the death of President Raisi, resulted in a surprise victory for Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist candidate. Pezeshkian, who campaigned on a platform of change and engagement with the West, secured 53.6% of the vote against conservative rival Saeed Jalili.  

Despite declining voter turnout in previous elections, a  significant resurgence of voters in the run-off, fueled by hopes for  reform, contributed to Pezeshkian's triumph.  His victory presents an opportunity for gradual reforms and diplomatic engagement, potentially easing the Islamic Republic's economic and social tensions. It remains to be seen how Pezeshkian, with his limited executive experience, will navigate the country's theocratic structure and the challenges ahead.

Pezeshkian, a relatively unknown figure before his candidacy, campaigned on a platform of social reform and engagement with the West, contrasting with the conservative incumbents.  His victory, secured with a near 50% turnout, comes after years of protests and calls for change from a frustrated public. While his powers are limited in Iran's theocratic system, his strong mandate presents an opportunity for gradual reforms and  a potential thawing of relations with the West.

He called for peace and stability, but also blamed the Congress for past handling of similar incidents. However, despite Modi's claims, Manipur remains far from normal with thousands displaced and unable to return home. Armed vigilantes operate freely, central agencies have taken over governance, and the state government lacks credibility.

Displaced people remain unable to return home, government services are disrupted, and armed vigilantes continue to operate.  Central agencies have effectively assumed control,  raising questions about the state government’s capacity to lead.

Keir Starmer's Labour Party secured a landslide victory in the UK general election, with 412 seats in Parliament.  This result signifies a decisive defeat for the Conservative Party after 14 years in power, with voters expressing dissatisfaction over Brexit, economic mismanagement, and various scandals. Starmer's agenda focuses on economic reform, including wealth creation for the working class, taxation of high earners, and investment in public services.  The election also saw the rise of Nigel Farage's Reform UK, which gained over 14% of the vote despite winning only four seats. Its success will likely pressure Starmer to address concerns about immigration.  Indian interests, particularly regarding the stalled India-UK Free Trade Agreement, will be closely watched as Starmer's government prioritizes economic recovery.

Keir Starmer's Labour Party achieved a landslide victory in the UK general election, securing 412 seats and granting Starmer a strong mandate to implement his agenda. This victory can be attributed to the Conservative Party's failings over the past 14 years, including mishandling of Brexit, economic struggles, and various scandals. 

Labour's priorities include wealth creation for the working class, higher taxes for the wealthy, phasing out fossil fuel vehicles by 2030, and establishing a new border control agency.  The rise of the far-right Reform UK, with its anti-immigration stance, presents a challenge for Starmer on this issue.  International relations, including the stalled India-UK FTA, will also be key areas of focus for the new Labour government.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Supreme Court ruled that Presidents have immunity from criminal prosecution, except for acts unrelated to their core constitutional duties. This decision, based on separation of powers, grants absolute immunity for core duties and presumptive immunity for official acts, while unofficial actions are not protected.  

The ruling doesn't directly address former President Trump's potential prosecution related to the 2020 election, but sets a threshold for future cases. Critics argue this verdict threatens democracy by shielding the President from accountability, potentially allowing for corrupt or illegal actions. While acknowledging the need to protect the Presidency from undue scrutiny, dissenting justices highlight the danger of unchecked power.
=======
The US Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, ruled that presidents have immunity from criminal prosecution for acts considered core constitutional duties.  For other official acts, they have presumptive immunity, and for unofficial acts, no immunity exists. The ruling stemmed from the doctrine of separation of powers and aims to protect the presidency from undue interference.  

While the decision doesn't directly address former President Donald Trump's alleged involvement in the 2020 election interference, it establishes a framework for future prosecutions. Critics argue this creates a dangerous precedent, potentially allowing presidents to act with impunity and violate the law, undermining democratic principles and accountability.

The eradication of wild-type poliovirus type-1 (WPV1) by 2026 faces challenges as the virus shows signs of resurgence in Pakistan and Afghanistan.  

Despite a decrease in cases in 2023 compared to 2022, recent months have seen an uptick, raising concerns about potential surpassing of 2022 case numbers.  The circulation of the virus in the environment is also increasing, with positive environmental samples found in areas historically associated with polio outbreaks.  This resurgence is attributed to challenges with vaccination coverage, including fake finger marking practices, leaving unvaccinated or incompletely vaccinated children vulnerable.  The situation in Pakistan appears particularly concerning, with the spread of WPV1 detected there after being mainly confined to Afghanistan in 2022.  
The movement of Afghan refugees further exacerbates the risk of international spread.
=======
Global efforts to eradicate wild poliovirus type-1 (WPV1) by 2026 face growing challenges. While the total number of WPV1 cases in Pakistan and Afghanistan in 2023 decreased compared to 2022,  a concerning uptick in cases has been observed in early 2024.

Positively, the virus is circulating in areas where immunization campaigns have not achieved the desired coverage. The presence of WPV1 in historical reservoirs in both countries, particularly cities like Karachi, calls for urgent action to prevent further spread. 
The situation is particularly worrisome due to the movement of refugees, which increases the risk of cross-border transmission.

Overcrowding, with an estimated 2.5 lakh attendees in a venue meant for 80,000, and a rush to collect soil near the preacher are cited as potential causes.  

The incident highlights the Uttar Pradesh administration's unpreparedness, evident in the inadequate response and resources.  Past tragedies involving large gatherings suggest that with proactive measures, the loss of life could have been prevented. This tragedy calls for stringent action against the responsible parties, a just compensation package for the victims' families, and improved crowd management strategies for future events.

A stampede at a religious gathering in Hathras, Uttar Pradesh, claimed over 120 lives, primarily women and children from vulnerable communities. The incident, which occurred during an address by  preacher Suraj Pal, is attributed to overcrowding as over 2.5 lakh people attended an event with a capacity for 80,000. Reports suggest the stampede was triggered by a rush to collect soil from around the preacher's feet. 

The Uttar Pradesh administration's preparedness has been severely criticized due to inadequate medical response and the absence of sufficient ambulances and staff. The tragedy highlights the lack of proactive measures by authorities despite past incidents.

The outcome is unlikely to significantly shift Iran's core policies, though the elected President can influence their implementation. Historically, reformists have struggled to deliver meaningful change due to the powerful influence of the Shia clergy and unelected institutions. Low voter turnout, at 39.9%, reflects public apathy and the limitations of Iran's political system.

The Supreme Court granted bail to Jharkhand's former Chief Minister and Jharkhand Mukti Morcha leader Hemant Soren. The bail comes after his five-month imprisonment under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA), stemming from a case alleging money laundering linked to land dealings.

The Jharkhand High Court, while granting bail, questioned the Enforcement Directorate's (ED) claims and methods. The court raised doubts about the ED's assertion that Soren had been plotting to build a banquet hall on the disputed land, based on a consultant's plan found on an accused's phone.  Furthermore, the court found the ED's accusation that Soren orchestrated a plan to have the land transferred to an individual to evade legal culpability to be unconvincing.
=======
The Jharkhand High Court granted bail to former Chief Minister Hemant Soren, who was arrested by the Enforcement Directorate (ED) under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA). The court, questioning the ED's case, highlighted inconsistencies and a lack of evidence to support claims of money laundering.

The court focused on the ED's assertion that Soren planned to build a banquet hall on land suspected to be acquired illegally. It pointed out the absence of any legal action by those allegedly evicted from the land and challenged the ED's reliance on a consultant's plan found on an accused person's phone. 

The judgment underscores concerns about the misuse of PMLA to target political opponents and raises questions about the speed at which arrests are made based on inferences and assumptions.

The GST Council, meeting for the first time in nine months, addressed numerous industry concerns and taxpayer grievances.  Key decisions include GST exemption for hostel accommodation under ₹20,000 per month and railway travel services for passengers.  A uniform 12% GST rate was set for packing cartons, milk cans, and solar cookers, simplifying classification.  The Council also extended a waiver for interest and penalty on tax dues for the first three years of GST, provided they are settled by March 2025. 


Other changes include the elimination of the anti-profiteering clause and the implementation of Aadhaar-based authentication for GST registrations. The Council plans to further review and rationalize the GST rate structure in its upcoming August meeting.

### [​Debt trap: On crisis in Kenya](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/%E2%80%8Bdebt-trap-on-crisis-in-kenya/article68344717.ece)

<<<<<<< HEAD
Kenyan President William Ruto's decision to rapidly pass an IMF-backed finance bill increasing taxes has sparked violent protests.  The bill, intended to raise 200 billion Kenyan shillings ($1.55 billion) to address Kenya's $80 billion debt, faced strong public opposition, leading to at least 23 deaths and 200 injuries.  

Despite the riots, the government argued that its hands were tied due to the country's heavy debt burden, which consumes over half of its revenue. This crisis highlights the pitfalls of relying heavily on debt for development, exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic and the Ukraine war. The IMF deal has drawn criticism for placing an undue burden on ordinary Kenyans.   

President Ruto has since withdrawn the bill and promised austerity measures, but he faces the difficult task of balancing his people's needs with Kenya's creditor demands.
=======
Kenyan President William Ruto faced public backlash and violence after attempting to fast-track an IMF-backed finance bill that proposed significant tax increases. The bill, which aimed to raise $1.55 billion, ignited protests resulting in at least 23 deaths and 200 injuries.  

Ruto ultimately withdrew the bill, acknowledging public discontent. The government justified the tax increases as necessary to address Kenya's massive debt burden, which reached $80 billion last year. 

Critics argue that Kenya's reliance on external loans for infrastructure projects, coupled with the global economic downturn and rising interest rates, has created a financial crisis that disproportionately affects the poor. The situation highlights the need for sustainable development models and debt relief for African nations.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Arvind Kejriwal's arrest by the CBI in the Delhi excise policy case raises concerns about bad faith. The timing of the arrest, just before the Supreme Court was set to hear an appeal regarding his bail in a related money-laundering case, suggests an attempt to deny him release.  

While the allegations against Mr. Kejriwal are serious, the investigation has been lengthy, relying largely on statements from pardoned accused. The High Court's decision to uphold the stay on his bail, contrasting with the lower court's initial ruling, highlights the politicization of the judiciary. 


The arrest underscores the need for impartial investigations and for those in power to avoid targeting opponents through legal means.  Mr. Kejriwal's decision not to resign immediately following his arrest also fuels perceptions of potential interference.
=======
The arrest of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal by the CBI in the Delhi excise policy corruption case is seen as politically motivated.  The timing of the arrest, just before the Supreme Court was set to hear an appeal regarding Kejriwal's bail in a related money-laundering case, raises concerns. While the accusation of Kejriwal benefiting from the controversial excise policy is serious, the investigation has been ongoing for two years with limited concrete evidence. The back-and-forth legal battles over bail highlight the politicization of the judicial system and cast doubt on the impartiality of the investigation. As the case progresses, it remains to be seen if the CBI can substantiate its allegations against Kejriwal.

### [Net damage: On the fisheries dispute, India and Sri Lanka](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/net-damage-on-the-fisheries-dispute-india-and-sri-lanka/article68340694.ece)

<<<<<<< HEAD
The recent resumption of fishing off India's eastern coast led to a clash between the Indian and Sri Lankan navies, resulting in the death of a Sri Lankan sailor. This incident reignited the long-standing dispute over fishing rights in the Palk Bay. 

Indian authorities have been working to secure the release of 40 Indian fishermen detained by Sri Lanka.  The situation calls for renewed dialogue between India and Sri Lanka to find a lasting solution to this sensitive issue.  Experts emphasize the need to address both the livelihood concerns of fishermen and the importance of marine ecosystem preservation.  The slow progress of India's deep-sea fishing project, aimed at providing alternative income sources for fishermen, further highlights the urgency for a comprehensive approach.
=======
The post-ban resumption of fishing off India's eastern coast led to a deadly incident involving the Sri Lankan Navy chasing Indian trawlers. The incident resulted in the impoundment of a trawler and the arrest of 10 fishermen (8 from Tamil Nadu, 2 from Andhra Pradesh).  

The Tamil Nadu Chief Minister requested intervention from the Indian External Affairs Minister for the release of the fishermen and their vessel. This incident highlights the ongoing maritime dispute between India and Sri Lanka regarding fishing rights. Both countries need to revive negotiations and find a solution that addresses the livelihood of fishermen while protecting the marine environment.  Alternatives like deep sea fishing, marine cage farming, seaweed cultivation, and sea ranching need to be explored and supported to help shift away from bottom trawling.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The 2023 Lok Sabha Speaker's resolution condemning the Emergency is viewed as  insufficient action given the government's own recent actions resembling Emergency-era tactics.  

The government's suppression of dissent through laws like preventive detention, targeting of Opposition figures, and curtailing press freedom are seen as a worrying trend echoing the dark chapter of the Emergency. The reduced majority of the BJP in the 18th Lok Sabha is interpreted as a signal that voters disapprove of these authoritarian tendencies. Moving forward, a robust Opposition, a vigilant judiciary, and a watchful civil society are crucial to prevent a repeat of the Emergency and protect democratic values in India.
=======
The article revisits the Emergency imposed in 1975,  criticizing its infringement on civil liberties and democratic principles. 

While condemning the Emergency, the Lok Sabha Speaker's recent actions, including suspending Opposition MPs, are seen as contradictory and hypocritical. The article argues that the BJP's government has employed similar tactics to stifle dissent, resorting to attacks on free press, selective targeting of Opposition members, and draconian laws to detain individuals. It concludes that a robust Opposition, a vigilant judiciary, and a committed civil society are crucial for India to truly move past the legacy of the Emergency and prevent its recurrence.

### [Ending defections: On politics in Telangana](https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/editorial/ending-defections-on-politics-in-telangana/article68336345.ece)

<<<<<<< HEAD
The recent defection of BRS MLA M. Sanjay Kumar to the ruling Congress in Telangana has reduced the opposition's strength in the Assembly. This event highlights the recurring issue of defections in Indian politics, with Telangana witnessing mass defections since its formation in 2014.

The incident raises concerns about the effectiveness of the Anti-Defection Law, which has provisions allowing disqualifications but lacks a clear timeline for decisions by Speakers. This ambiguity, coupled with the Speaker's inherent political allegiance, often renders the law ineffective. 


The defection also underscores the importance of a strong opposition for robust democracy and checks on the ruling party's power. The past decade has shown the dangers of single-party dominance, both at the national and state levels, emphasizing the need for stronger safeguards against defections.
=======
The defection of MLA M. Sanjay Kumar from the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) to the ruling Congress in Telangana has reduced the Opposition's strength in the Assembly.  Defections have plagued Indian politics since 2014, with Telangana witnessing significant defections during K Chandrashekhar Rao's first term as Chief Minister. The 10th Schedule of the Anti-Defection Law allows for exceptions if two-thirds of a party member merges with another, hindering its effectiveness.

The current defection has caused tension within the Congress, especially as it involves the candidate who lost the Jagtial Assembly seat. This incident highlights the need to strengthen the anti-defection law, possibly by vesting the power to decide disqualifications with an independent Election Commission, to uphold democratic principles and ensure a robust Opposition.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Prime Minister Modi's call for consensus governing in the 18th Lok Sabha first session has been met with mixed signals. While both the NDA and the INDIA bloc reiterate their commitment to the Constitution, their political discourse remains contentious.  They are currently clashing over the Speaker and Deputy Speaker positions. Despite the BJP's slim majority, the opposition's willingness to support the NDA's candidate for Speaker in exchange for the Deputy Speaker post offers a potential avenue for  cooperation.  

The success of Modi's call for consensus hinges on tangible actions, such as frequent interactions between the government and the opposition. This might not always be achievable, but it could contribute to political stability and pave the way for  shared decision-making on critical issues.
=======
Prime Minister Modi has called for consensus in governing, despite  evident tension between the NDA and the INDIA bloc. Both sides reiterate their commitment to the Constitution, but concrete displays of collaboration remain absent.  The first session highlighted this divide,  with disagreements over the pro tem Speaker and the upcoming Speaker’s election. While the Opposition has offered support for the NDA’s candidate in exchange for the Deputy Speaker's position, the BJP remains non-committal.  Modi's rhetoric on consensus and parliamentary debate holds promise, but   tangible action is needed.  Building coalitions and fostering constructive engagement between the ruling party and the opposition are crucial for India's progress.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, will be released after a 14-year ordeal. He will plead guilty in the U.S. to espionage charges related to publishing classified documents, receiving a sentence of five years, the time he's already served in British prison. Assange's release comes after years of legal battles and international pressure.  

The case highlights the clash between press freedom and national security, particularly concerning the prosecution of a publisher for revealing government secrets. Assange's treatment stands in contrast to that of Chelsea Manning, who leaked the same information and was imprisoned for 35 years before her sentence was commuted.
=======
Julian Assange, the WikiLeaks founder, is to be released after a plea deal in a US espionage case. He will plead guilty and be sentenced to five years, the time he has already served in detention. 

Assange was arrested in 2010 on European charges of sex crimes, which were later dropped. He then sought asylum in the Ecuador embassy, only to be extradited to the UK and then face US charges in 2019 for publishing classified documents.  

While his release is a victory for his supporters, concerns remain about the precedent set by convicting a journalist for publishing classified information and the lengthy persecution he endured.

<<<<<<< HEAD
Over a year since ethnic violence erupted in Manipur, killing 221 and displacing 50,000,  peace remains elusive. The conflict has spread to previously peaceful districts, fueled by armed militias with looted weaponry. While the central government has imposed quasi-Article 355 rule, Prime Minister Modi's involvement remains minimal. Despite security briefings by Home Minister Amit Shah, the situation worsens.

The recent general election saw the opposition Congress party win decisively, signaling public dissatisfaction. A change in leadership is necessary, but simply reshuffling officials won't suffice. Disarming militias, empowering peace-seeking civil society actors, and fostering reconciliation between ethnic groups are crucial steps towards restoring normalcy.
=======
Despite a year passing since ethnic violence erupted in Manipur, the state remains volatile. The conflict has spread to previously peaceful districts, fueled by the proliferation of armed militias wielding looted weapons. The federal government's attempts to maintain peace through indirect means of Article 355 and the current leadership, while prioritizing security briefings, have proven ineffective. 

The recent general election results, where the Congress party achieved a decisive victory despite intimidation tactics, underscore the people's dissatisfaction with the status quo. Urgent action is needed to disarm militias, empower peace-building civil society organizations, and foster reconciliation between ethnic groups. A leadership change is essential, accompanied by a genuine commitment to addressing the root causes of the conflict and restoring normalcy to Manipur.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Indian government's ₹72,000-crore infrastructure project on Great Nicobar Island is facing scrutiny over its environmental and social impacts. The project, which includes a trans-shipment port, airport, and power plant, will necessitate clearing over 130 sq. km of forest, potentially harming rare species and the island's delicate ecosystem.  While compensatory afforestation is planned, its effectiveness remains questionable given the vast ecological differences between the affected rainforest and the designated area in Haryana. Concerns have also been raised regarding the lack of transparency in the environmental clearance process and potential violations of the rights of the indigenous Shompen tribe.
=======
The Union Tribal Affairs Ministry is reviewing forest clearance documents for the ₹72,000-crore Great Nicobar Project, a controversial initiative that involves substantial infrastructure development on the island.  The project, facing criticism for its potential environmental and social impact, aims to build a port, airport, township, and power plant, potentially affecting over 130 sq. km of pristine forest and home to rare species. While the government highlights strategic advantages, critics point to tourism as a key driver.  Lack of transparency surrounding the environmental clearance process and concerns over tribal consent have prompted scrutiny from the National Commission for Scheduled Tribes and the National Green Tribunal.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The Patna High Court struck down Bihar's increased reservation policy, citing the 50% ceiling imposed by judicial precedents. The government had raised quotas for various backward classes, based on a caste survey, aiming for "proportionate equality". The court, however, upheld the principle that 'adequate representation' does not equal 'proportionate representation'. 

While acknowledging the possibility of exceeding the quota in "extraordinary situations", the court denied Bihar's plea, arguing that geographical remoteness was the only justifying factor. This decision raises questions about Bihar's ability to implement social justice programs despite its backwardness. The court also highlighted the lack of in-depth study before implementing the enhanced reservation, prompting scrutiny of the caste survey's comprehensiveness.
=======
The Patna High Court has struck down Bihar's enhanced reservation policy, citing the 50% ceiling limit set by judiciary precedent. The court invalidated the government's amendments, which raised reservations for Backward Classes, Extremely Backward Communities, Scheduled Castes, and Scheduled Tribes.  

The government's attempt to justify the increased quotas based on caste-wise population figures and the state's social backwardness was rejected. While acknowledging the need for social justice, the court stressed the constitutional limit on reservations, even when special circumstances are argued.  The court's decision raises concerns about Bihar's ability to address historical disadvantages faced by certain communities, despite its efforts to implement a more equitable system.

<<<<<<< HEAD
The upcoming by-election in Vikravandi, Tamil Nadu, is marked by the AIADMK's decision to boycott, citing fears of electoral malpractice. This move, likely influenced by the party's poor performance in the 2024 general election, comes amid concerns that the DMK may resort to money and muscle power. 

Despite past instances of electoral irregularities, including allegations of bribery and voter intimidation, the Election Commission of India (ECI) has rarely taken strict action against parties involved.  The success of this by-election hinges on the ECI's ability to ensure a free and fair process, curbing the influence of money and freebies, and dispelling doubts about its impartiality.
=======
The upcoming by-election in Vikravandi, Tamil Nadu has taken an unusual turn with the AIADMK boycotting the poll. Citing concerns about potential misuse of money and muscle power, the AIADMK, which suffered a significant defeat in the 2024 general election, may be attempting to avoid another loss and potentially wooing back the PMK.  The boycott raises questions about the seriousness of the opposition and puts pressure on the Election Commission of India (ECI) to ensure a free and fair election. 

Concerns about bribery persist, and the ECI's role in enforcing existing laws against electoral offenses is crucial. The ECI's past actions, while strong in some instances, have been inconsistent, prompting calls for a clear message against bribery and the influence of money in elections.

The cancellation of the UGC-NET examination due to alleged irregularities casts a shadow on the National Testing Agency's (NTA) credibility. This incident, following concerns raised about NEET-UG and JEE, has pressured the Ministry of Education to take swift action.  

While the Ministry promptly vowed to conduct a fresh exam and initiated a CBI probe, many examinees feel the lack of transparency is concerning. Questions remain unanswered regarding the sudden shift to an offline exam format and  potential vulnerability to leaks. The NTA faces demands for accountability, systemic overhaul, and scrutiny regarding its handling of technical issues, cheating, and previous examination controversies.

The cancellation of the UGC-NET exam following allegations of irregularities has further damaged the National Testing Agency (NTA)'s credibility. This incident, coupled with controversies surrounding NEET-UG and JEE exams, places the NTA under intense scrutiny.  The government's swift action in cancelling the UGC-NET and initiating a CBI probe contrasts with its handling of the NEET paper leak issue.  The reversal to an offline exam format for UGC-NET raises questions about vulnerability to leaks. 

Full transparency, accountability for those responsible, and a potential overhaul of NTA's systems are crucial to restore public trust.  The NTA's troubles have become politicized, with some demanding its dismantling and a return of examination responsibility to the states.
