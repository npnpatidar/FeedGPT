### [Japan: Where did Fumio Kishida go wrong?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/japan-where-did-fumio-kishida-go-wrong-13807924.html)

Fumio Kishida, facing declining public support and internal party pressure, chose to step down as Prime Minister of Japan. Economic stagnation, despite his "New Capitalism" initiative, coupled with scandals within the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), led to falling approval ratings.  

Kishida's focus on foreign policy, particularly strengthening ties with the US amidst rising tensions with China, was seen by some as neglecting domestic concerns.  His attempts at digitalization and economic revitalization faced public resistance, and policies aimed at addressing inflation failed to gain traction.

Shigeru Ishiba, a former defense minister, is among those vying to succeed Kishida, who is leaving office after a three-year term as LDP leader. The LDP seeks to present a united front and regain public trust  under new leadership ahead of upcoming general elections.

### [How India-Japan 2+2 dialogue isn’t just about countering ‘China threat’](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-india-japan-22-dialogue-isnt-just-about-countering-china-threat-13807880.html)

The recent 2+2 ministerial dialogue between India and Japan highlighted the growing strategic convergence between the two nations.  Both countries share concerns over China's expansionist policies in the Indo-Pacific region, aligning with Japan's  "Free and Open Indo-Pacific (FOIP)" vision. 

Defense cooperation has intensified, with Japan  considering removing bottlenecks for sharing advanced technology with India.  

Economic ties are also strengthening, with Japan emerging as the largest development partner for India's northeast and Bangladesh. Projects like the Mumbai-Ahmedabad high-speed rail line and industrial corridors demonstrate Japanese commitment to India's development. 

Despite challenges such as potential changes in Japanese leadership and a shift in Japan's stance towards China, both countries  find ample motivation for deeper cooperation, driven by India's emerging market and Japan's desire for technological and investment opportunities.

### [Ramification | Why Myanmar is not a walkover for China](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ramification-why-myanmar-is-not-a-walkover-for-china-13807856.html)

Since the 2021 military coup in Myanmar, the country's situation has remained unstable, posing concerns for neighboring countries like India and China. China, particularly, is worried as its significant investments in Myanmar's infrastructure projects, intended to bypass the Strait of Malacca, are threatened by the junta's inability to control the situation. 

The emergence of Operation 1027, led by ethnic armed organizations (EAOs) against the junta, reflects this growing tension. Though China strategically supported the initial operation, it has expressed reservations about a subsequent operation. Compounding the issue is the Tatmadaw's distrust of China and its alignment with Russia for a new deep-sea port, potentially undermining China's strategic ambitions. 

While India shares concerns with China regarding Myanmar's instability, it maintains goodwill with various stakeholders, including the junta, the National Unity Government, and some EAOs. India’s approach prioritizes engagement with all parties and safeguarding its interests while providing humanitarian aid.

PM Modi's recent visit to Ukraine, the first by an Indian prime minister since the country's independence, carried significant weight amidst the ongoing conflict.  India, while advocating for peace and diplomacy,  explored opportunities for strategic collaboration with Ukraine, particularly in defense manufacturing, which has been disrupted due to the war. 

Discussions focused on  achieving a peaceful resolution, defense and economic cooperation, and India's role in Ukraine's post-war reconstruction. The visit aimed to strengthen ties with Ukraine, while also navigating the complex geopolitical landscape  marked by India's  relations with both Russia and the West.

The rising political influence of the Indian-American community is a key factor in the upcoming US elections. With a significant and growing population, they are being actively courted by both Democratic and Republican parties.

Kamala Harris's historic vice presidency adds to their visibility and the Hindu vote is seen as crucial, particularly in swing states. Organizations like the Hindu American PAC are advocating for their concerns, mirroring the successful strategies of previous India-focused lobbies.

Indian-Americans are making their mark on American politics and are poised to become even more influential in the future.

### [Flood row: Is anti-India rhetoric camouflaging Bangladesh’s own shortcomings?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/flood-row-is-anti-india-rhetoric-camouflaging-bangladeshs-own-shortcomings-13807456.html)

A recent devastating flood in Bangladesh has triggered accusations against India, with some blaming the Indian government for releasing water from the Dumbur reservoir in Tripura.  However, experts like Professor Mashfiqus Salehin argue that the primary cause of the flooding was the heavy rainfall in the catchment areas, not the dam's water release.  He points out that the dam is located far from the Bangladeshi border and that India has been sharing real-time flood data with Bangladesh. Salehin also emphasizes that Bangladesh's inadequate flood management infrastructure is a contributing factor to the severity of the situation. While India has acknowledged Bangladesh's concerns, it maintains that the flooding is primarily due to heavy rainfall.  The focus should be on improving flood preparedness and fostering collaborative efforts between India and Bangladesh to manage shared water resources.

### [Getting Indian Army future-ready: Why lean, mean, modern military is need of hour](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/getting-indian-army-future-ready-why-lean-mean-modern-military-is-need-of-hour-13807503.html)

The Indian Army is facing a manpower shortage, prompting discussion about necessary reforms. The article examines how the US and China have successfully reduced their military manpower, highlighting the factors and strategies involved.  

The US downsized its forces following the Cold War, leveraging technological advancements to offset troop reductions. China, similarly,  reduced its army size after improving its technological capabilities and securing its borders, allowing it to focus on modernization and strategic thinking.

The article emphasizes that military modernization and human resource reforms are interconnected and require careful planning, financial commitment, and long-term strategies. Given India's complex security situation, including border disputes and internal challenges, the need for a comprehensive assessment and a well-defined roadmap for both modernization and manpower optimization is crucial.

### [How Ukraine’s Kursk incursion is a bold Queen’s Gambit](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-ukraines-kursk-incursion-is-a-bold-queens-gambit-13807480.html)

Ukraine's incursion into Russia's Kursk region is a bold strategic move that has caught Moscow off guard.  The attack, which breaches Russian territory and targets a key military district, undermines Russia's image of invulnerability and pressures the Kremlin.  However, Ukraine's success depends on its ability to sustain the offensive, as resources are stretched thin.  While the Kursk operation has symbolic value, the crucial battleground remains in Donetsk, where Ukraine faces a difficult and attritional fight.   The long-term outcome hinges on Ukraine's ability to balance the gains from the Kursk operation with the demands of the war in Donetsk.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Kyiv is seen as a potential opportunity for India to play a significant role in mediating a peaceful resolution to the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  

While acknowledging the need for India to stand against any threats to its territorial integrity posed by a growing alliance between Russia, China, North Korea, and Iran, Lord Mandelson argues that India's economic and geopolitical influence positions it to broker a peace deal.  

The visit comes at a time when Western support for Ukraine might diminish due to growing economic fatigue and a potential change in US leadership. Rebuilding Ukraine's infrastructure will be a costly endeavor, and India's position as a bridge between the US-led West and the Russia-China bloc could prove valuable in navigating this complex geopolitical landscape.  Modi's recent comments emphasizing the necessity of this era being "not of war" highlight India's desire to promote peace and stability.

This article critiques Western media's portrayal of events in Bangladesh following the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and the subsequent violence against the Hindu minority.  

The author argues that Western media outlets have downplayed the extent of the violence and have even blamed Hindus for the attacks by emphasizing their political affiliation with the former government. They cite examples of reports that falsely claim a lack of attacks on Hindus or that shift the blame to misinformation and propaganda. The author also highlights instances where Western media outlets have avoided criticizing the West Bengal Chief Minister for serious lapses in procedure following the brutal rape and murder of a doctor, framing the issue as a symptom of Indian patriarchy instead.  

The author concludes by stating that as long as Western hegemony over global discourse remains unchallenged, India and Hindus will continue to be marginalized and misrepresented.

### [Time to reassess India’s neighbourhood challenges amid Bangladesh crisis](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/time-to-reassess-indias-neighbourhood-challenges-amid-bangladesh-crisis-13807279.html)

India's complex neighborhood relations stem from its historical, cultural, and civilizational ties with its neighbors, creating both opportunities and challenges.

India's pursuit of regional primacy has sometimes been perceived as hegemony, leading to resentment.  The country faces ongoing challenges such as anti-India sentiment in certain nations, fueled politically. India's past practice of favoring specific political sides within its neighbors has exacerbated these issues. 

The growing economic and political influence of China further complicates matters, as South Asian nations increasingly see China as a counterbalance to India.  China's active policy of engaging with India's neighbors, including resolving border disputes with most, presents a direct challenge to India's regional standing.  

India's entanglement in border disputes and its susceptibility to regional instability due to ethnic conflicts and refugee flows also pose unique challenges. The US, while traditionally present in the region, has at times pursued policies that have indirectly benefitted its rival, Pakistan, further complicating India's security environment. 

Managing these multifaceted challenges requires India to adapt its foreign policy, embrace pragmatic solutions, and actively engage with a wider range of stakeholders in its neighborhood.

The Harris-Walz campaign aims to defeat Donald Trump by contrasting their optimistic vision of America with his darker portrayal. They are focusing on energising the electorate, particularly by targeting key demographics like young voters, minorities, women, and moderates.

Their strategy emphasizes unity and opportunity, addressing economic issues like inflation while promoting policies to benefit working class families. Harris's economic agenda includes measures to lower financial burdens on families, such as eliminating medical debt, providing subsidies for first-time homebuyers, and expanding access to affordable healthcare.  

 While Trump remains a formidable opponent due to his populist messaging, media savvy, and control over his narrative, the Harris-Walz campaign believes that a powerful and persuasive vision for America can  transcend his polarizing platform and secure a decisive victory.

Vietnamese President To Lam's visit to China signals the close ties between the two Communist nations despite the South China Sea dispute.  Vietnam, China's priority in regional diplomacy, shares economic and trade agreements with Beijing.  

Despite historical tensions and overlapping territorial claims, Vietnam has strengthened relations with the Philippines and the US, participating in joint coast guard exercises and upgrading ties with Washington. Hanoi's strategic balancing act includes expanding its outposts in the Spratly Islands while maintaining economic ties with China.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's upcoming visit to Ukraine signals a potential attempt by India to initiate dialogue between Russia and Ukraine amidst a devastating war.  While the situation is complex, given the heavy casualties, economic ripple effects, and geopolitical tensions, India has domestic reasons for seeking a peaceful resolution, including the impact of soaring oil prices and disruptions in its supply chains.

Ukraine's defense industry, historically linked to Russia, is undergoing a transformation, potentially creating new opportunities for India in terms of defense cooperation.  However, reaching a negotiated settlement faces challenges, as both sides seek to claim victory and secure favorable terms. India will play a crucial role in mediating between the warring nations, leveraging its relationships with both sides to facilitate talks and ultimately contribute to ending the conflict.

### [Dealing with growing radicalisation in South Asia](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/dealing-with-growing-radicalisation-in-south-asia-13806884.html)

Islamist radicalism presents a growing threat to peace and stability in South Asia, stemming from historical roots of violence and forced conversions. The region's diverse religious landscape, combined with socio-economic grievances and political instability, provides fertile ground for extremist ideologies to flourish. 

Pakistan serves as a significant breeding ground for Islamist radical groups, while Afghanistan's Taliban resurgence has emboldened similar movements. India faces challenges from both internal and external Islamist threats, with groups exploiting religious tensions and the country's large Muslim population for recruitment. Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives have also experienced increasing Islamist radical activity, highlighting the region's vulnerability. 

Addressing this complex issue requires multifaceted approaches, including community engagement, investment in education, counter-narratives, security measures, inclusive governance, and international cooperation.  Efforts must target the root causes of radicalization, address grievances, and promote tolerance and understanding.  Collaborating to counter online radicalization and disrupt extremist networks is crucial for mitigating the threat to regional and global security.

### [PM Modi’s Independence Day speech: The long and short of it](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/pm-modis-independence-day-speech-the-long-and-short-of-it-13806873.html)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Independence Day speech from the Red Fort, while comprehensive, lacked the usual impact. The excessive length of 98 minutes, coupled with the scorching weather, resulted in a lackluster delivery. The speech delved into too much detail about government achievements, neglecting the opportunity to present a few broad and relevant messages for the nation.  

It missed the chance to address pressing issues like unemployment, inflation, and farmers' plight, and lacked concrete schemes with deadlines to demonstrate the government's commitment to solutions.  This missed opportunity could have been used to regain lost ground after the BJP's setback in the last national elections.

The recent mass protests and, subsequent regime change in Bangladesh has sparked a discussion about India's role in the situation. Despite the political turmoil, India has maintained a united front with Bangladesh, acting responsibly and confidently in its approach. 

Some argue that India has overextended its support towards Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, potentially overlooking other political players in Bangladesh. However, India's stance stems from the need to maintain stability in the region and its long-standing ties with the elected government.


 

Now that former Prime Minister Hasina has sought refuge in India, the question arises about the potential for her extradition. Bangladesh's new interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, has stressed the need for order and democracy, while simultaneously calling on India to uphold the rule of law. 

The situation remains delicate, with India walking a tightrope between supporting its ally and addressing the concerns of the Bangladeshi people and its new leadership.

Malaysian Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim's visit to India signifies a renewed emphasis on bilateral ties. Malaysia seeks India's support for its BRICS membership, aiming to diversify its trade and investment landscape amidst escalating US-China tensions. The relationship, previously strained, has seen a revival under the current leadership.  

India's economic growth and strategic positioning make it an attractive partner for Malaysia and other nations seeking to balance China's growing influence in the Asia-Pacific region. India's approach, contrasting with China's hierarchical model, emphasizes peaceful coexistence and multi-state systems.  

The two countries share deep civilisational ties, with a significant Indian diaspora in Malaysia.  They are committing to strengthen these ties through cultural exchange, including promoting Ayurveda and establishing scholarships.

Biden, concluding his political career, relinquished the spotlight at the Democratic National Convention, speaking late at night before departing for vacation. Harris, seemingly poised to succeed him,  received a coronation-like atmosphere. Despite displays of unity and optimism,  concerns linger about Harris' economic acumen, evidenced by her calls for price controls.  She faces scrutiny for her policy proposals, particularly their feasibility and potential consequences.  Trump's campaign will likely capitalize on these vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, the Democratic establishment, led by figures like Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, aims to secure another victory in the White House. Whether Biden's departure will pave the way for Harris or embolden new GOP strategy remains to be seen.

A new report by the Chinese Foreign Ministry paints the National Endowment for Democracy (NED) as a tool of US foreign policy, accusing it of meddling in the internal affairs of other nations.  The report alleges that the NED supports pro-US forces, manipulates elections, and incites division to undermine stability. Specific examples cited include the NED's alleged funding of Uyghur and Tibetan diaspora groups and its criticism of Indian democracy. The report concludes by calling on countries worldwide to be aware of the NED's activities and protect their own interests.

India has a long tradition of revered saints. However,  a number of self-proclaimed godmen have also emerged, exploiting the vulnerable and poor. These individuals accumulate wealth, power, and influence, often facing accusations of  sexual assault and other crimes. They attract followers from marginalized communities who seek solace and an alternative to the existing social hierarchy. Despite lacking credibility and operating outside legal boundaries, they often enjoy political protection. Addressing this issue requires not only legal measures but also deep societal reforms to tackle poverty, inequality, and caste-based discrimination.

### [Could Moneyball methodology improve Indian cricket?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/could-moneyball-methodology-improve-indian-cricket-13806487.html)

This article suggests that the Indian Premier League (IPL) should adopt a "Moneyball" approach to its player rankings.  The current system, while utilizing points based on runs, wickets, and fielding, is criticized for being too simplistic and failing to account for factors like strike rate, economy rate, and consistency.  

The author, along with colleagues, developed a new metric using multivariate regression that considers batting efficiency, bowling control, wicket-taking, and fielding impact.  This revised method demonstrated a strong correlation with team win percentages and more accurately reflects the value of diverse player contributions.  The article uses examples from the 2021 season to illustrate how the new system would have recognized players like KL Rahul and AB de Villiers more effectively.   


The ultimate goal is to create a more competitive and nuanced IPL ranking system that aligns with the strategic importance of various player attributes in cricket.  The hope is that this change will further elevate the quality of the IPL and potentially solidify India's dominance in international cricket.

Bangladesh faces a precarious future following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Her decision to label Islamist groups as militant, while stemming from a genuine concern for rising extremism, triggered a volatile political climate. Clashes between these groups and security forces have intensified, creating an environment of uncertainty.

Extremist groups, previously subdued, are capitalizing on this instability. Resurgent militant organizations, including those associated with Al-Qaeda and ISIS, are re-emerging, spreading their propaganda and calling for the establishment of an Islamic state. This resurgence is further fueled by sectarian violence against minority communities, driving a wedge in the already fragile social fabric. 

The political vacuum has also attracted outside influences, with allegations of foreign involvement in the regime change, though these remain unproven. The situation in Bangladesh resembles that of Pakistan, highlighting the risk of internal instability destabilizing the region.

India, closely watching the developments, recognizes the potential impact on its own security and stability. As Bangladesh grapples with these challenges, the international community, including India, must remain committed to supporting efforts to maintain peace and prevent extremist elements from gaining a foothold.

### [South China Sea: How growing Chinese assertiveness finds strong Philippine response](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/south-china-sea-how-growing-chinese-assertiveness-finds-strong-philippine-response-13806334.html)

Relations between China and the Philippines have been strained by recurring maritime skirmishes in the South China Sea, particularly around the disputed Second Thomas Shoal. Chinese coast guard vessels have escalated their actions, engaging in ramming and water cannon attacks on Philippine ships attempting to resupply the BRP Sierra Madre, a grounded Philippine warship stationed on the shoal.  

This escalating tension stems from competing territorial claims. While China asserts historical sovereignty over the vast majority of the South China Sea, the Philippines, citing the UNCLOS, maintains its sovereign rights within its exclusive economic zone. Attempts at dialogue through the Bilateral Consultation Mechanism (BCM) have yielded limited success, with each side reiterating its position and refusing to concede. 

The PCA's 2016 ruling in favor of the Philippines, coupled with renewed security ties between the Philippines and the US, suggests a shift in the Philippines' approach, becoming less receptive to China's coercive tactics. China's reliance on a  "carrots and sticks" approach is no longer effective, and Beijing must be prepared to deal with a more assertive Manila.

Alain Delon, a French cinematic icon, has died at the age of 88. Renowned for his magnetic screen presence and undeniable charisma, Delon transcended the boundaries of mere acting to become a symbol of French culture and global cinema.  His career spanned decades, marked by transformative performances in films like "Le Cercle Rouge," "Le Samouraï," and "Monsieur Klein," where he showcased his range and complexity.  Delon's on-screen partnerships, particularly with actresses like Monica Vitti and Catherine Deneuve, sparked unforgettable chemistry.

This article discusses the potential for US covert regime change in Bangladesh, referencing alleged US attempts to influence Bangladesh's leadership and control of key strategic assets like ports. The article draws parallels to past covert operations, particularly the 1953 coup in Iran and the alleged US involvement in the 2014 Maidan Revolution in Ukraine, highlighting the complexities and risks associated with such interventions. 

It argues that despite the US government's pursuit of regime change, such efforts often have unintended consequences. The article cites research showing that foreign-imposed regime change can lead to economic decline, reduced democracy scores, and weakened civil liberties. It concludes by emphasizing the potential for instability in the Indian subcontinent if US covert operations in Bangladesh are successful and urges India to proactively engage diplomatically in response.

### [Can Ukraine’s Kursk offensive help Kyiv achieve strategic dividend?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/russia-ukraine-war-can-ukraines-kursk-offensive-help-kyiv-achieve-strategic-dividend-13806052.html)

Ukraine's surprise ground offensive into Russia's Kursk region has captured significant territory and marked the first instance of foreign troops occupying Russian land since World War II. 

The operation, executed with secrecy, has raised strategic questions about potential aims. Ukraine could be seeking to weaken Russian forces, divert their attention from other fronts, or leverage captured territory in future negotiations.  The incursion has also prompted debate about the use of Western weaponry in a conflict that directly challenges Russian sovereignty.

While Russia hasn't ruled out nuclear threats, it is actively countering the offensive, securing gains in eastern Ukraine and preparing for potential eviction of Ukrainian forces. The situation draws parallels to historical examples like the German invasion of Kursk during World War II, highlighting the potential risks of overextension and the need for strategic planning and resource management.   The long-term implications of this audacious Ukrainian move remain uncertain, leaving questions about whether it will escalate the conflict, push Russia toward negotiations, or reshape the dynamics of the war entirely.

The article discusses the current state of global turmoil, citing conflicts in Ukraine and Israel, economic woes in China, political instabilities in various nations, and environmental challenges.  

Drawing upon the writings of Sri Aurobindo, the author argues that this  "Hour of God" demands introspection, purification, and bold action. India, though politically stable, needs to embrace  Decentralized governance, innovation, and its core values to navigate these turbulent times. The article emphasizes the need for India to resist  external pressures and forge its own path, relying on its strengths and historical wisdom.

### [How hosting Olympics may not be a good option for India](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-hosting-olympics-may-not-be-a-good-option-for-india-13805831.html)

The article argues that India should reconsider its bid to host the 2036 Olympics.  It points out that hosting the Games has often resulted in financial losses for countries, citing examples like Greece and Rio de Janeiro.  The author suggests that the costs associated with building and maintaining Olympic infrastructure outweigh any potential revenue or economic benefits.  

India's experience with the 2010 Commonwealth Games, marred by corruption and financial mismanagement, further reinforces the argument against hosting the Olympics.  The article proposes that instead of pursuing the costly and risky endeavor of hosting the Olympics, India should focus on developing a strong sports culture at the grassroots level by investing in smaller sports facilities.  

It concludes by emphasizing the need for realism and pragmatism in India's approach to sports development.

### [Why PM Modi's visit to Ukraine and Poland will be closely watched](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-pm-modis-visit-ukraine-and-poland-will-be-closely-watched-13805817.html)

India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi made a significant visit to Poland emphasizing the long-standing friendship between the two nations. This visit followed a trip to Russia  and precedes a planned meeting with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy. While India maintains close ties with both countries, it is seeking to balance its relationships amid the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.  India has engaged in trade with both Russia and Ukraine, particularly in defense equipment.

Modi's visit aims to understand the perspectives of both sides and promote peace. Poland, a staunch supporter of Ukraine, has provided substantial military aid and has seen a significant influx of Ukrainian refugees.

### [How American strategy of ‘colour revolutions’ teaches third-world democracies a lesson](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-american-strategy-of-colour-revolutions-teaches-third-world-democracies-a-lesson-13805774.html)

The US, despite claiming to be a global leader for good, has a deeply problematic history of interfering in the internal affairs of other nations.  Its support for "Color Revolutions" and coups has resulted in widespread instability, economic decline, and the rise of authoritarian regimes.  

Instead of engaging in diplomatic efforts with legitimate governments, the US often works with opposition groups and fuels unrest, as seen in Bangladesh where the recent overthrow of the democratically elected government is being attributed to US encouragement. This disregard for democratic principles and the tendency to prioritize strategic interests over human rights has destabilized regions and undermined international trust.

### [Shadow Warrior | How Big Tech, mass media nexus 'manufactures consent’ favouring vested interests](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/shadow-warrior-how-big-tech-mass-media-nexus-manufactures-consent-favouring-vested-interests-13805760.html)

The Western media often manufactures consent by promoting the viewpoints of powerful interests through market forces, gaslighting, and self-censorship. This can lead to abrupt shifts in narratives, as seen with historical figures like Manuel Noriega and Saddam Hussein, as well as more recent examples like Sheikh Hasina. 

Big Tech platforms accelerate this process, enabling the swift construction of narratives and the silencing of dissent.  Social media giants, including Wikipedia, are susceptible to manipulation by biased editors or those with vested interests, perpetuating misinformation as fact.  The author argues that India must protect itself from this Western influence by building its own indigenous solutions and limiting access to these platforms.

### [Why Sheikh Hasina’s extradition to Bangladesh isn’t a realistic scenario](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-sheikh-hasinas-extradition-to-bangladesh-isnt-a-realistic-scenario-13805587.html)

The recent coup in Bangladesh, resulting in the ousting of Sheikh Hasina and her subsequent refuge in India, has sparked controversy regarding potential extradition charges against her. While charges of murder, abduction, and genocide have emerged, they lack sufficient legal standing and are considered dubious post-Hasina's departure.

India, already hosting a significant number of Bangladeshi immigrants, including the Rohingyas, is unlikely to extradite Hasina.  

The coup leaders, under a provisional government headed by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, face challenges in legitimizing their authority and establishing stability. The future political landscape remains uncertain with the emergence of a new student-led political party. 
                                    
India's strong economic ties and strategic importance to Bangladesh suggest that seeking Hasina's extradition would be detrimental to both nations, potentially benefiting adversaries like China and Pakistan.

### [Let’s demand the end of child marriage: Our children are not for sale](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/lets-demand-the-end-of-child-marriage-our-children-are-not-for-sale-13805554.html)

In India, child marriage remains a prevalent issue despite significant progress in recent years. Though 3 girls are married off every minute in India, child marriage cases are rarely registered. The practice is deeply rooted in social and cultural norms, often driven by poverty and a lack of education for girls. Child marriage has devastating consequences for girls, including physical and mental health risks, limited educational opportunities, and vulnerability to sexual exploitation. 

To combat this issue, Bhuwan Ribhu, a child rights activist, advocates for a multi-pronged approach that includes strengthening laws, raising awareness, promoting education, empowering girls, and holding perpetrators accountable. He emphasizes the need for a clear message from the state and society that children are not for sale and that child marriage is a crime. Ribhu believes that addressing child marriage in a concentrated manner within districts with the highest prevalence rates can create a tipping point towards ending the practice nationwide.

### [Japan: As Kishida steps down amid sinking popularity, LDP faces a leadership crisis](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/japan-as-kishida-steps-down-amid-sinking-popularity-ldp-faces-a-leadership-crisis-13805547.html)

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida has announced his resignation as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and PM.  The decision is driven by several factors, primarily his declining popularity, a record low of 15.5% in July 2024, due to the ongoing LDP financing scandal and concerns about his leadership. Kishida's attempts to reform the LDP by reducing the influence of factions and promoting a cleaner image have been unsuccessful. Recent domestic events, including a megaquake warning that disrupted his diplomatic engagements, also contributed to the decision. 

Kishida steps down hoping to pave the way for a new LDP leader to revitalize the party and regain public trust for the upcoming October 2025 general election. Several potential candidates have emerged, including Ishiba Shigeru, Kono Taro, and Noda Seko.

South Asia's economic instability presents an opportunity for India to strengthen its position. While the region grapples with challenges like political turmoil and unsustainable debt, India's economy is thriving, attracting foreign investment and offering a stable platform for growth.

India's economic reforms and competitive edge, coupled with the limitations of Chinese investment, are making it the natural choice for businesses and investors.  Countries like Pakistan, Sri Lanka, and Bangladesh are struggling to find alternatives to partnership with India, realizing that economic collaboration is key to escaping poverty and achieving prosperity.

### [How Sheikh Hasina’s ouster will impact India’s Act East policy](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-sheikh-hasinas-ouster-will-impact-indias-act-east-policy-13805507.html)

The recent military-backed ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in Bangladesh has created uncertainty in the region and its impact on India-Bangladesh relations. The coup, whose motivations are complex and involve student discontent and a lack of connection with the younger generation, has implications for Bangladesh's political landscape and its future trajectory.

This shift in power raises concerns for India, as it has enjoyed close ties with Hasina's administration, marked by progress in trade, connectivity, and defense cooperation.  A destabilized  Bangladesh poses challenges for India's Northeast region, given its shared borders and the ongoing issues in Myanmar, Manipur, and the Naga accord.  The situation could also destabilize BIMSTEC, a regional grouping seen as an alternative to SAARC.

India has consistently championed the concerns of the Global South, particularly during its G20 Presidency.  Recognizing the unique challenges faced by developing nations, Prime Minister Narendra Modi organized the Voice of the Global South Summit (VOGSS). This platform allows leaders from the Global South to voice their concerns and contribute to the G20 agenda. 

India emphasizes the importance of representation, urging for increased participation of the Global South in international institutions. Key issues discussed include responding to the priorities of the Global South, recognizing their differentiated responsibilities, respecting sovereignty, and reforming global institutions. The summits have fostered cooperation on areas like sustainable development, climate change, health, and technology. India aims to empower the Global South through knowledge sharing, capacity building, and promoting indigenous solutions.

### [Why ISRO’s third and final development flight of Small Satellite Launch Vehicle is significant](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-isros-third-and-final-development-flight-of-small-satellite-launch-vehicle-is-significant-13805371.html)

ISRO successfully launched the SSLV-D3 mission, marking the completion of development flights for the Small Satellite Launch Vehicle.  This launch is significant as SSLV is designed to carry 500kg satellites to Low Earth Orbit and offers a more cost-effective solution compared to the PSLV for smaller payloads. With the success of SSLV-D3, ISRO now has a fully operational launch vehicle capable of meeting the growing demand for launching small satellites, both commercially and strategically. 

SSLV's quick turnaround time (72-hours assembly) and ability to launch multiple satellites in diverse orbits make it attractive for businesses and research institutions.  Additionally, the mission showcases advancements in ISRO's technology, including the improved IMS-1 satellite bus system and the integration of advanced technologies like Microsatellite Antenna arrays and flexible solar panels. 
 ISRO plans to transfer SSLV technology to private companies, further bolstering India's space sector.

### [Why India should worry about a Kamala Harris presidency](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-india-should-worry-about-a-kamala-harris-presidency-13805290.html)

While an Indian-American president like Kamala Harris would be a historic achievement, concerns arise about its potential impact on US-India relations. Unlike past administrations that prioritized cooperation with India, Harris's potential approach appears more aligned with partisan stances and online activism. 

Her selection of Tim Walz as a running mate, after a controversial campaign, suggests a willingness to cater to the far-left faction within the Democratic party.  This could lead to prioritizing anti-India sentiments and policies regarding Hinduphobia, denigration of Indian democracy, and support for Khalistan separatism. Furthermore, her lack of experience and commitment to strong US-India ties, coupled with a State Department influenced by biased human rights groups, could result in the exacerbation of existing tensions and diplomatic crises.  A Harris presidency could significantly damage the US-India relationship, marking a significant downturn since the Cold War era.

### [How ex-ISI chief’s arrest shows Pakistan Army’s paranoia](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-ex-isi-chiefs-arrest-shows-pakistan-armys-self-destructive-paranoia-13805206.html)

The arrest of Lt Gen Faiz Hameed, the first ever intelligence chief of Pakistan to be arrested, highlights concerns about the direction of the Pakistani army.  Hameed's career was marked by his involvement in various controversial operations, including the backing of right-wing groups and alleged interference in political affairs.

His arrest, along with other recent incidents like the resignation of Lt Gen Ayman Bilal Safdar and the crackdown on those sympathetic to Imran Khan, point towards a growing internal conflict and paranoia within the army. This  erosion of discipline and integrity in the military, coupled with allegations of corruption and misuse of power, raises serious concerns about the stability of Pakistan. The article suggests that the current army chief, Gen Asim Munir, is driving this trend, creating a climate of distrust and fear. The author concludes that India should consider these developments carefully as they impact security and stability in the region.

### [Maldives turnaround shows why India's setback in Bangladesh will not be permanent](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/maldives-turnaround-shows-why-indias-setback-in-bangladesh-will-not-be-permanent-13805140.html)

Despite pessimism in India following the shift in Bangladesh's leadership away from the pro-India Sheikh Hasina, maintaining engagement remains crucial.  Similar sentiments occurred earlier this year regarding India-Maldives relations, which saw a cooling period after Mohamed Muizzu, a leader who campaigned on an "India Out" platform, took office. However,  India continued to provide development assistance and engage diplomatically. This pragmatism ultimately paid off, with ties between India and the Maldives now showing a marked improvement.  

India's  engagement with the Maldives exemplifies  the importance of continued diplomacy in the neighborhood, despite challenging political shifts. This approach should also be applied to Bangladesh, where India can maintain beneficial relations regardless of the ruling party. India's support, both economic and security-wise, remains vital for Bangladesh, and prioritizing engagement will ultimately serve Indian strategic interests in the region.

A violent mob attacked RG Kar Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata, destroying property and threatening medical staff. Eyewitnesses say the mob, armed with weapons, vandalized the hospital for 40 minutes while police were largely absent, even hiding themselves from the attackers.

Opposition leaders and the state's governor accused the police of complicity and the ruling party of orchestrating the attack to cover up evidence in the recent rape and murder of a trainee doctor.  The incident sparked outrage, with women across the state protesting for justice. 

The Calcutta High Court transferred the case to the CBI and criticized the Kolkata Police for their handling of the investigation.  West Bengal's chief minister has called for swift justice but is facing criticism for her attempts to deflect blame and use the incident for political gain.

China's economic growth is slowing, raising concerns among policymakers and investors.  Despite recent measures to stimulate the economy, including boosting consumption and supporting private investment, China's second-quarter growth fell short of expectations.  Several challenges threaten China's economic future, including trade tensions, a corporate debt crisis, a cooling property market, and a shrinking workforce due to an ageing population. To avoid falling into the middle-income trap, China needs sustained growth of 6-7% over the coming decade.  Economic success is crucial to the legitimacy of the Chinese Communist Party's rule and the "Chinese Dream" of prosperity.

Bangladesh is experiencing a turbulent period following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation amidst nationwide protests. Triggered by the reinstatement of a quota system for government jobs, the demonstrations escalated into violence, leading to hundreds of deaths.  While the Supreme Court adjusted the quota, the protests continued, demanding Hasina's removal and exposing concerns about her governance. 

A controversial military-backed interim government now heads the nation. Muhammad Yunus, a Nobel Laureate and Hasina critic, leads the interim government with a cabinet assigned major portfolios. The situation remains tense, with protestors continuing their actions and the military's role raising questions about the future of democracy in Bangladesh. 

The country faces significant geopolitical challenges, with international powers like China and the US capitalizing on the instability. India, concerned about the impact on its strategic interests, is watching developments closely.

### [Beyond the Lines | The uprising of 1946: The story behind India’s freedom at midnight](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/beyond-the-lines-the-uprising-of-1946-the-story-behind-indias-freedom-at-midnight-13804708.html)

The 1946 Royal Indian Navy Mutiny was a pivotal moment in India's struggle for independence. Sparked by poor treatment and inspired by Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose's Indian National Army, sailors in Bombay revolted, quickly expanding to other naval bases and even air force establishments. The mutiny garnered widespread public support, highlighting the increasingly volatile situation within the British Empire.  

Although the British government eventually quelled the uprising, it significantly rattled the Raj, forcing them to consider their options in India. The mutiny was a testament to the Indian people's desire for freedom, showcasing their willingness to fight for independence. Ironically, while the uprising threatened to overshadow the existing political movement, key Indian leaders like Gandhi, Nehru, and Patel failed to fully embrace or endorse the mutinous actions. The missed opportunity to unify the country behind a popular and assertive movement further fragmented the path to independence. John Freeman, the British High Commissioner,  acknowledged the mutiny's potential to spark another large-scale rebellion like the 1857 uprising. Despite its importance, the 1946 mutiny is often overlooked in discussions of India's independence, serving as a reminder of  a potent but ultimately thwarted moment in history.

The ongoing war between Israel and Hamas has escalated significantly, spreading conflicts to Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, and even Iran. Israel blamed the Hamas attacks on October 7th for its current aggressive posture, which includes targeted assassinations of key figures within Hamas and other Iranian-backed groups.  This escalation is a response to perceived vulnerabilities after the October 7th Hamas attack. 

Israel believes that its Arab neighbors' normalization with Israel should have minimized Iranian influence in the region. However, the conflict with Palestinians remains an obstacle to achieving greater regional stability. While assassinations may appear to be victories, true security can only be achieved through a lasting peace agreement with Palestinians.

This article analyzes the sudden shift in public perception surrounding Kamala Harris, the Democratic Party's presidential pick. Despite previously low approval ratings and criticism from various media outlets, Harris is now being portrayed as a champion of democracy and liberalism. 

The article attributes this turnaround to a deliberate effort to position her as a foil to the perceived threat posed by Donald Trump.  Harris's  vague and  "progressive" stance on foreign policy issues, particularly regarding  Israel and India, is highlighted as a potential concern. 

The author suggests that narrative manipulation, especially by global powers, plays a crucial role in shaping public opinion and influencing election outcomes. The article warns that the world should brace for turbulent times ahead due to these evolving  power dynamics.

### [Ramification | Bangladesh: How Muhammad Yunus is wearing a crown of thorns](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ramification-bangladesh-how-muhammad-yunus-is-wearing-a-crown-of-thorns-13804451.html)

Following protests triggered by a High Court ruling reinstating a quota system, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina fled Bangladesh to India. This change in leadership has sparked concern, particularly regarding the rise of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) and its ally, the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI).

JeI, with ties to past atrocities during Bangladesh's liberation war,  is seen as a threat to religious and political minorities. A possible resurgence of JeI, coupled with existing instability, raises fears of lawlessness and renewed violence. 

India, watching closely, faces the challenge of navigating this volatile situation. They must support minorities and advocate for democratic processes while engaging with the new interim government led by Muhammed Yunus. 


Finding a balance between supporting democratic ideals and ensuring stability becomes crucial for India's interests and the well-being of the region.

### [Ex-ISI chief Faiz Hameed’s arrest shows the mess Pakistan finds itself in](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ex-isi-chief-faiz-hameeds-arrest-shows-the-mess-pakistan-finds-itself-in-13804377.html)

Pakistani Army Chief Gen Asim Munir initiated disciplinary action and a Field General Court Martial against former DG ISI Lt Gen Faiz Hameed. This action stems from a Supreme Court case filed last year involving an allegation of extortion against Hameed. Though the court forwarded the matter to the government for investigation, the allegations of post-retirement violations of the Army Act against Hameed appear broader in scope.  

This arrest comes amid jubilation in Pakistan over athlete Arshad Nadeem's gold medal win at the Paris Olympics. Munir's timing has sparked speculation about the action being a pre-emptive move against potential dissent within the military, overshadowing the national celebration. 

The article highlights the ongoing tensions between Munir and former PM Imran Khan,  drawing parallels to past instances where the Pakistani army derailed peace initiatives with India. It concludes by emphasizing Pakistan's continued instability, linking it to its antagonistic stance towards India and its inability to keep pace with India's progress.

### [Budget and after: Time to prioritise agriculture, health and education](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/budget-and-after-time-to-prioritise-agriculture-health-and-education-13804261.html)

The provided article argues that achieving the goal of Viksit Bharat is impossible unless the needs of India's poorest, particularly those in rural areas, are addressed.  The author emphasizes that the benefits of India's economic growth are not distributed equally, as evidenced by low per capita income and a large agricultural population struggling with low productivity. 

They highlight the need for a new agricultural revolution, urging for investment in technology, infrastructure, and R&D to boost farm incomes. The article criticizes current government subsidies and schemes, deeming them as palliatives rather than solutions and calls for a negotiated Minimum Support Price to incentivize farmers. 

Ultimately, the author advocates for policymakers to prioritize agricultural reform, healthcare, and education to uplift the majority of India's population and ensure inclusive growth.

### [How regime change in Bangladesh is an immediate setback for India in the neighbourhood](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-regime-change-in-bangladesh-is-an-immediate-setback-for-india-in-the-neighbourhood-13804241.html)

A new interim government has been established in Bangladesh under Muhammed Yunus, following the resignation of Sheikh Hasina's administration.  Yunus, a respected figure with links to the US, faces the challenges of restoring order and managing the country's political landscape in an environment marked by street protests and judicial instability. 

India's primary concern is the restoration of stability, the safety of its Hindu minority, and the potential for increased Chinese influence. While the US has called for a democratic transition, its silence regarding the minorities’ security has drawn criticism from India.

The former Indian Foreign Secretary Kanwal Sibal argues that the US's approach to Bangladesh does not align with India's strategic interests, particularly in the context of growing Chinese involvement in the region. He highlights the potential for the new government to adopt a more China-friendly stance, posing a challenge to India's security and its Act East policy.

### [Human rights debacle in Britain: West must end double standard](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/human-rights-debacle-in-britain-west-must-end-double-standard-13804133.html)

This article discusses the double standards of Western countries regarding human rights. It argues that Western media and governments selectively highlight human rights violations in the Global South while downplaying or ignoring similar issues within their own borders. 

The author cites examples of anti-minority riots in the UK, US sanctions against Belarus, and reports from international organizations criticizing human rights practices in the West.  Despite these reports, the author observes a lack of vocal response from the Global South, suggesting that more consistent criticism from developing nations could expose and challenge the West's hypocrisy on human rights. The article concludes by urging Western governments to abandon their double standards and uphold human rights consistently.

The recent upheaval in Bangladesh, marked by the ousting of Sheikh Hasina, creates a complex geopolitical situation in South Asia. This shift threatens regional stability and India's security interests due to Bangladesh's strategic location and importance. 

China's growing influence in Bangladesh, fueled by infrastructure investments and military cooperation, presents a major challenge for India. Simultaneously, the rise of radical Islamist groups exploiting the political instability further complicates the landscape. India must navigate this volatile situation cautiously.

India needs to engage in diplomatic dialogue with the new regime in Bangladesh while prioritizing the safety of its citizens and Hindus in the country.  Leveraging its historical and cultural ties, India should focus on strengthening economic cooperation and enhancing connectivity projects.  Moreover, India must remain vigilant against Chinese geopolitical ambitions and actively counter Islamist radicalization in the region to safeguard its own interests.

Prime Minister Modi's upcoming visit to Ukraine amidst shifting global dynamics highlights India's delicate balancing act. The visit, following Modi's meeting with Putin, signals India's attempt to navigate the complex relationships between the US-led West and the Russia-China axis. 

The world order has been significantly altered by the rise of China, the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and regional instabilities. India, asserting strategic autonomy, engages with both blocs while seeking to leverage its economic growth and potential as a mediator.

Recent moves such as allowing selected Chinese investments in India and conciliatory statements from both countries indicate a potential thaw in India-China relations, driven by shared economic interests. 

Modi's meeting with Zelenskyy underscores India's position as a key player striving to maintain peace and foster dialogue in this increasingly fractured global landscape.

Kamala Harris's rise to the forefront of American politics has taken an unexpected turn. 

After a period of relative obscurity as Vice President, she has become the Democratic nominee following President Biden's withdrawal from the race. She has quickly energized the party base, raising a record amount of campaign funds and assembling a strong team. Harris has focused her campaign on highlighting the contrasts between herself and her Republican opponent, Donald Trump, painting him as a threat to democracy and emphasizing her commitment to issues like women's rights and gun control. This assertive approach has shifted the momentum in the race, making it a genuine contest. Despite the challenges ahead, Harris has proven herself to be a formidable candidate, posing a serious challenge to Trump's reelection bid.

### [‘An Islamist-sponsored, state-sanctioned apartheid’: Why time is ripe to amend regressive and repressive waqf laws](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/an-islamist-sponsored-state-sanctioned-apartheid-why-time-is-ripe-to-amend-regressive-and-repressive-waqf-laws-13803836.html)

This article argues that India's Waqf Act, which governs Muslim religious endowments, is discriminatory and needs to be amended. 

The author contends that the Act has been progressively tilted in favor of Waqf Boards, granting them excessive power and undermining the rights of non-Muslims.  They cite examples like the Waqf Board's jurisdiction over land and property disputes, its composition dominated by Muslims, and the removal of time-bar limitations in claiming waqf property. 

The article further criticizes the hypocrisy of political parties, particularly those who oppose recent amendments to the Waqf Act while simultaneously advocating for appeasement of Muslims. The author concludes that these laws perpetuate  discrimination and  "apartheid" against the Hindu majority.

### [How Bangladesh crisis resembles closely with West-orchestrated ‘colour revolutions’ and Arab Spring](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-bangladesh-crisis-resembles-closely-with-west-orchestrated-colour-revolutions-and-arab-spring-13803791.html)

The recent coup in Bangladesh, which ousted the democratically elected Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has raised concerns about the country's political future. Parallels can be drawn between this event and colour revolutions in other parts of the world, such as those in the post-Soviet space and the Arab Spring.  The coup was orchestrated by the Bangladesh Army, with support from radical Islamist groups like Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP).  

While the interim government headed by Muhammad Yunus aims to restore order and hold elections, its legitimacy is questionable. The prominent role of JeI and BNP, both known for anti-minority sentiments, raises fears for the safety of Bangladesh's Hindu population, which has already seen a decline in numbers over the years. 

This political instability has the potential to significantly impact Bangladesh's socio-economic progress and has wider geopolitical ramifications.

Hindus in Bangladesh face a severe and systematic decline  in their  numbers due to persistent violence and discrimination. Despite a secular facade,  Hindus suffer during religious celebrations, with 2021’s Durga Puja seeing widespread attacks on communities,  including killings and cases of gang rape. The government’s response has been inadequate, with assailants often enjoying impunity. 

The international community's silence on this issue further exacerbates the problem.  

 Urgent and decisive action is needed to protect Hindus, ensure justice for victims, and address systemic discrimination.

Hamas is proving to be highly resilient in the ongoing conflict with Israel. Despite significant casualties, the  organization has bolstered its ranks through recruitment, aided by the devastation in Gaza which has fueled anger and frustration among the population.  Hamas's adaptation to guerrilla warfare tactics, particularly its extensive network of tunnels, has also proven challenging for the IDF. 

 The group's "beehive leadership" structure ensures continuity even with the loss of key figures. Israel's attempts to clear and hold territory have been hampered by the lack of an established infrastructure for reconstruction and the prevalence of underground booby traps and IEDs.  
The combination of harsh living conditions, resentment of Israel, and Hamas's effective utilization of this environment paints a grim picture for Israel's ability to achieve a decisive victory.  Hamas continues to pose a significant and enduring challenge to Israeli security, relying on its deep roots in the Palestinian community and a cunning adaptation to guerrilla tactics.

Indian President Droupadi Murmu's state visit to Timor-Leste, a first for an Indian head of state, signals the growing importance of Timor-Leste in India's strategic calculations. The visit follows Timor-Leste's admission as an ASEAN observer and its future full membership, integrating it into India's "Act East" policy. 

Both countries have expressed strong commitment to deepening relations across various sectors, including technology, agriculture, health, and capacity building. This multifaceted engagement is further strengthened by upcoming resident missions in each other's capitals and the potential for Timor-Leste to benefit from the India-ASEAN Fund. The visit included the signing of three MoUs promoting cultural exchange, visa-free access for diplomats and officials, and program sharing through broadcasting entities.

Bangladesh is currently in a state of political upheaval following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. An interim government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has been formed to steer the country through this period of instability. This transition comes amid increasing Islamist influence, particularly from the Jamaat-e-Islami party, which has a history of violence and close ties to militancy.  The rise of Jamaat-e-Islami is a significant concern for India, as it threatens Bangladesh's secular identity and poses a potential security risk. 

The situation is further complicated by China's growing influence in the region, with its Belt and Road Initiative potentially drawing Bangladesh into a closer partnership with China, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, challenging India's regional dominance. This new geopolitical landscape  presents a serious challenge for India and requires a proactive and strategic response to protect its interests.

AI is increasingly used in criminal activities, posing a significant threat globally.  Deepfakes facilitate disinformation, while AI enhances phishing and social engineering attacks. Cybercriminals leverage AI to identify vulnerabilities and launch sophisticated attacks. AI-driven malware adapts to evade detection, and voice cloning enables financial fraud.

The autonomous nature of AI systems complicates liability, making it difficult to determine who is responsible for criminal acts. Attributing actions to specific AIs in complex, interconnected systems is another major challenge. 

Addressing this issue requires a multi-pronged approach. This includes international cooperation to establish regulations and norms for AI development and usage, revising legal frameworks to address AI-related crimes, investing in technical solutions to detect and mitigate malicious AI, and fostering an ethical AI culture.

While student protests can be heroic, they can also be morally problematic, naive and even dangerous. History provides numerous examples of student movements that turned violent or aligned with harmful ideologies.  The  1968 US protests reflect class divisions, as university students, often privileged, clashed with the "silent majority."  Similarly,  in France, student unrest did not reflect the broader population's support.  The simplistic view of student protesters as inherently good needs critical evaluation, especially when  considering movements that advocate violence or overthrow existing systems.

### [Minority report: Bangladesh crisis shows why CAA is relevant](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/minority-report-bangladesh-crisis-shows-why-caa-is-relevant-13803401.html)

The recent upheaval in Bangladesh has highlighted the plight of the Hindu minority, who have been disproportionately impacted by violence and persecution. The student-led protests, initially focused on job quotas, escalated into unrest fueled by the radical Jamaat-e-Islami, which has a history of opposing Bangladesh's independence and advocates for the implementation of Islamic law.  

The violence against Hindus underscores the fragility of linguistic nationalism and exposes the deep-rooted religious divisions within Bangladesh.  Despite claims of Bengali unity, the reality on the ground reveals a vulnerable community facing systematic discrimination and displacement. 

The situation in Bangladesh emphasizes the urgency of the Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in India, which offers refuge to persecuted minorities from neighboring countries.  The CAA serves as a humanitarian gesture, providing a safe haven for those facing religious persecution and seeking asylum.

A tweet by Jyotiraditya Scindia sparked discussion about Olympic champion Neeraj Chopra's ancestry, suggesting he possessed "Maratha spirit."  This led to attention being drawn to the Rod Marathas, a community residing in Haryana with customs and culture similar to the Marathas.  

Research points to the community's origins in the aftermath of the 1761 Battle of Panipat, where a contingent of Maratha soldiers and non-combatants, fleeing the Afghan victory, settled in the region. While Chopra's family denies a direct link, the existence of the Rod Marathas offers a unique example of a historical event shaping a distinct community centuries later.

Following the resignation of Bangladesh's long-serving Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, international powers are jostling for influence in the strategically important South Asian nation. China has significantly increased its military and economic ties with Bangladesh, viewing it as a counterbalance to India. 

The US, on the other hand, has expressed support for regime change in Bangladesh,  criticizing elections that they alleged were unfair and pushing for closer ties with the opposition party, BNP. A potential US military base in Bangladesh raised concerns in India and remains a point of contention.

Meanwhile, India is trying to maintain its influence in Bangladesh, despite the growing presence of China and the US.  The future trajectory of Bangladesh's relationship with these powers will have significant implications for regional geopolitics.

The United States and Russia actively engage in the international arms trade, supporting opposing sides in critical geopolitical regions. The US has a strong military partnership with Israel, providing substantial aid and advanced weaponry to counter Iranian influence in the Middle East.  Russia, conversely, arms states often at odds with US interests, including Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah. 

This rivalry fuels an arms race, increasing regional instability and raising the risk of escalating conflicts. The influx of advanced weaponry makes peaceful resolution of disputes more challenging, while state-sponsored actors like Hezbollah introduce further unpredictability. This dynamic extends beyond the Middle East, impacting global security as seen in conflicts like the war in Ukraine.  
 
The international community faces a challenge in managing this competition and preventing further escalation.  Promoting dialogue, cooperation, and disarmament is crucial to avoid a more unstable and conflict-ridden world.

Sheikh Hasina's resignation has significantly impacted Bangladesh's political landscape and its relations with India. The period of unprecedented cooperation during her tenure, marked by economic growth, security cooperation, and regional connectivity, is now uncertain.  A new government, potentially more aligned with the West, raises questions about the continuity of these efforts and presents both opportunities and challenges for India. 

Maintaining economic cooperation, securing collaboration on counter-terrorism, and ensuring the progress of regional connectivity initiatives will be crucial. India should prioritize engaging with the new government, emphasizing stability, development, and mutual interests while promoting a balanced foreign policy in Bangladesh.

This article discusses Israel's history of targeted killings, particularly against Iranian figures. It uses the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran as a jumping-off point to explore the Israeli agency's history, ranging from the assassination of Sheikh Ahmed Yassin in 2004 to the use of AI to kill Mohsen Fakrizadeh, Iran's top nuclear scientist, in 2020. 

The article highlights the evolving tactics of Israeli intelligence, from parcel bombs in the 1980s to sophisticated AI-controlled assassinations. It also touches on the moral and strategic dilemmas involved in these operations, referencing the debate surrounding the assassination of Ali Akbar Mohtashmipur, a key figure in the formation of Hezbollah.

The author argues that the coup in Bangladesh was followed by a resurgence of religious persecution and a threat to freedom of speech.  Citing attacks on the Hindu community and the lynching of an actor and producer, the author expresses concern that a new generation of autocrats and religious zealots is rising. They highlight the appointment of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as interim leader, fearing his acceptance might legitimize the new regime.  While Yunus has called for an end to violence against minorities, the author questions whether he will truly have influence in curbing the escalating authoritarianism.

The article criticizes the UN's "International Day of the World’s Indigenous Peoples," arguing that it is a Western attempt to deflect responsibility for historic atrocities against indigenous populations. It highlights the  date's connection to the massacre of the Powhatan tribe in America in 1610,  claiming it was chosen to mask colonial guilt.

The author asserts that India should not participate in this observed day, arguing that all Indians are indigenous to the subcontinent.  Instead, they propose celebrating figures like Mata Shabari, Jharkahan heroes like Bhagwan Birsa Munda, or Rani Gaidinliu, who embody Indian indigenous pride.  The author concludes by arguing that "Janjatiya Gaurav Divas" (Tribal Pride Day), established by the Indian government, is a more appropriate celebration of India's indigenous heritage.

Sheikh Hasina's resignation and departure from Bangladesh after facing popular unrest and student demonstrations has left the Awami League in a precarious position. Her sudden exit, reminiscent of past dynastic collapses, contrasts with her father's legacy, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who died valiantly in a coup. 

While the Bangladesh Army orchestrated Hasina's escape, her departure has heightened concerns about the future of the Awami League and potential shifts in Bangladesh's political landscape. Critics suggest Hasina exhibited autocratic tendencies and failed to adequately empower the party, leading to its current vulnerability. The student movement that forced her exit mirrors previous instances of successful student activism in overthrowing dictatorships in Bangladesh.

Hasina's departure may embolden forces critical of India and potentially spark an exodus of Hindu refugees from Bangladesh, jeopardizing the already strained Indo-Bangladesh relationship.

Bangladesh is experiencing a deep political crisis following mass student protests and the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.  The country has a long history of political instability, marked by military coups, violence, and a deep mistrust between the two main political parties, the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. The army has a long tradition of intervening in politics, and the current army chief's intentions remain unclear.  Adding to the turmoil, student power has grown significantly, fueled by Islamic radicalization and a desire for change. The release of BNP leader Khaleda Zia further complicates the situation.  
External actors, like Pakistan, may also be seeking to exploit the instability for their own purposes.  With a weak interim government led by the aging Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, Bangladesh faces a uncertain future and a high risk of prolonged internal conflict.

A series of targeted assassinations of Iranian proxy leaders by Israel, including Hamas' Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah's Fuad Shukr, has significantly escalated tensions in the Middle East.

While Israel remains officially silent, the actions are widely attributed to the Mossad and suggest a shift towards a more focused strategy of targeting key Iranian figures.  Iran, facing a major security breach and a blow to its credibility, is expected to respond.  

The US, balancing its support for Israel with concerns about escalating conflict, is bolstering Israel's defenses but also pushing for negotiations and a ceasefire. Hezbollah, less capable of conventional warfare, may opt for standoff attacks.  The global community faces potential economic fallout from the heightened tensions, with pressure on oil prices and global trade routes.

The article draws parallels between Sikh extremism and past experiences with Islamist extremism. 

It argues that, similar to how some Muslim organizations exploited democratic freedoms for their own agendas, pro-Khalistan activists are using   Sikh communities for political gain.  The author cites pro-Khalistan activism's history of violence and intimidation within Sikh communities and  their demands for an independent state that include Pakistani territory, suggesting foreign influence.  The author suggests that Canada and the US should learn from the UK's experience, which identified and addressed the problem of extremists hijacking religious institutions for political purposes.   Finally, the article  concludes that tolerating Khalistan extremism undermines the very religious freedom it seeks to protect.

### [‘A quiet case of ethnic cleansing’: Why we don’t care enough for minorities in Bangladesh – and Pakistan](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/a-quiet-case-of-ethnic-cleansing-why-we-dont-care-enough-for-minorities-in-bangladesh-and-pakistan-13802439.html)

The article discusses the persecution of Hindus in Bangladesh following the fall of the Sheikh Hasina government. Despite previous support for Hasina, Hindus faced violence, attacks on their homes and temples, and looting, reminiscent of past atrocities  The article contrasts this with the indifference of some Hindus in India who remain unaware or choose to downplay the situation. It highlights a lack of support for Bangladeshi Hindus both within their own community and from their coreligionists in India.  The author draws parallels to the tragedy of the Jewish experience during the Holocaust and the enduring memory it holds as a stark reminder of the consequences of apathy and silence in the face of persecution.

### [Who will really be running Bangladesh now?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/who-will-really-be-running-bangladesh-now-13802429.html)

Recent protests in Bangladesh led to the dissolution of Parliament and the appointment of Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus as interim leader.  These protests, spearheaded by self-proclaimed student leaders, were initially focused on challenging quotas for government jobs for the families of freedom fighters. However, the protests evolved into a broader movement aimed at removing Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and her government.

Yunus, known for his work with the Grameen Bank, was chosen by these student groups, raising questions about their legitimacy and potential foreign influence.  Some suspect Islamist groups, possibly backed by China, played a role in orchestrating the unrest. 

The situation raises concerns about the future direction of Bangladesh, with questions surrounding Yunus's ability to govern effectively alongside potentially conflicting political interests. The involvement of past political figures and the unclear motivations of the student movement create a complex and uncertain political landscape in the country.

Following the targeted assassinations of Hamas and Hezbollah leaders, Israel faces a looming retaliatory strike from Iran and its proxies.

Iran, the key player, possesses a substantial arsenal of missiles, including medium- and long-range ballistic missiles capable of reaching Israel.  It also has a collection of  drones, such as the Shahed series, which have been used in previous attacks.

Hezbollah, equipped by Iran, boasts a large inventory of missiles, rockets, and anti-tank weapons, along with advanced drones. They have proven their ability to threaten Israel's defenses during the current conflict.

The Houthis, backed by Iran, are also armed with missiles and drones, including the Qadr family and Chinese C-802 anti-ship missiles. They can strike targets within Israel's  range using these assets.

Hamas, while lacking a conventional military, utilizes guerilla tactics and possesses short-range rockets and anti-tank weapons.  The militias in Iraq and Syria,  directed by Iran, present an additional threat through attacks against US forces.

Israel, with its sophisticated air defense systems and US support, is preparing for a fierce response. The unfolding situation raises concerns about regional escalation and the potential for a broader war.

### [Bangladesh is in the throes of Islamist pogrom against minority Hindus, and our liberals are busy obfuscating reality](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-is-in-the-throes-of-islamist-pogrom-against-minority-hindus-and-our-liberals-are-busy-obfuscating-reality-13802267.html)

Amidst a student-led movement in Bangladesh aimed at ousting Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, concerns are rising over the escalating violence against the Hindu minority. Reports suggest Islamist groups, including the banned Jamaat-e-Islami and its affiliates, are exploiting the chaos to target Hindus, leading to widespread attacks on their homes, businesses, and temples. 

Despite a history of persecution, some Indian liberals have chosen to downplay the severity of the situation, even calling accounts of violence "exaggerated" or "spun." This silence is attributed to a desire to protect the narrative of Muslims as victims and prevent any potential Hindu mobilization in India.

Meanwhile, the Bangladeshi people, including Hindus who participated in the initial protests, are now facing a terrifying reality as they are targeted and left vulnerable. Reports indicate that law enforcement is overwhelmed and unable to protect the minority community.

Kamala Harris selected Tim Walz as her running mate after evaluating several options. His experience as a two-term governor of a key Midwestern state and twelve years in the House of Representatives make him a strong contender. 

Walz's centrist views balance Harris's progressive stance, and his background as a white male veteran is seen as appealing to a wider demographic. 

The choice was also strategic, as it aims to secure support in crucial swing states and counter Trump and Vance's appeal to certain voters. Some criticize Walz's record on issues like immigration, but the campaign believes his experience and demeanor will be assets.

### [Bangladesh crisis: A play of invisible Chinese hand?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-crisis-a-play-of-invisible-chinese-hand-13802059.html)

Recent events in Bangladesh, including the sudden resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, suggest potential Chinese involvement in a potential coup. This development aligns with China's expanding engagement with Islamic extremist groups globally. 

China's initial focus was on using Pakistan as a counter to India, coupled with diplomatic efforts in the Middle East and the Organisation of Islamic Countries (OIC).  The country has moved towards supporting non-state actors, such as collaborating with Pakistan-backed terrorists in Kashmir and recognizing the Taliban to counter ISIS-K and East Turkistan rebels. 

In the Middle East, China has supported Hamas and other Palestinian groups, raising concerns about its intentions. In Bangladesh, Hasina, who cracked down on Islamist groups,  is seen as a pro-India leader, making her an undesirable ally for Beijing. 


The situation in Bangladesh complicates India's economic and security interests in the region, potentially hindering its trade initiatives and leaving it vulnerable to increased migration and violence. China's growing alliance with Islamic extremist groups, initially a tactic to deflect criticism over its Uyghur policies, is now destabilizing democracies and reshaping the geopolitical landscape.

India and Bangladesh share a complex relationship, with India closely monitoring Bangladesh's internal developments.  Sheikh Hasina's leadership, despite facing challenges, has been supported by India due to her strong stance against cross-border infiltration. However, recent events in Bangladesh, following a disputed election, raise questions about India's strategy.  Some argue India could have encouraged a more inclusive approach,  potentially mitigating the current political instability.  

The situation in Bangladesh has parallels to historical events, such as the 1975 crisis in India, and highlights the risks of political turmoil for regional stability. India faces the challenge of navigating these turbulent times diplomatically, carefully balancing its relationships with various global powers.

### [From hope to despair: Testing time for democracy in Bangladesh](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/from-hope-to-despair-testing-time-for-democracy-in-bangladesh-13801957.html)

Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, resigned and fled to India amid widespread student protests that escalated into violence and resulted in the deaths of over 300 people.  

The protests, initially focused on quota reforms in government jobs, took a radical turn with the involvement of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh and its student wing, Islami Chhatra Shibir.  These groups, known for their anti-Awami League stance and historical links to collaborators with Pakistan during the 1971 Liberation War,  incited violence and sought Hasina's removal. 

The army intervened, imposed an interim government, and banned Jamaat, leading to further unrest. The situation has worsened, with attacks on Hindus, looting, and the release of jailed opposition leader Khaleda Zia, signaling a potential rise of the BNP in alliance with Jamaat. 

The article warns that Bangladesh's future looks uncertain, with a possible return to military rule as the army, now in control, consolidates its power in collaboration with or confrontation against Jamaat-BNP.

The sudden resignation of Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, following widespread protests over a quota system for government jobs, marks a significant political shift in the country.  The protests, fueled by public discontent and exploited by opposition groups, escalated into riots and violence, leading to a significant loss of life.

The Hasina government's initial response was seen as heavy-handed, contributing to the escalation of the situation.  The army's eventual intervention, though prompted by a plea from retired officers and public pressure, suggests a breakdown of civilian authority.

India, which shares a close relationship with Bangladesh, must navigate this volatile situation carefully. Strengthening ties with all political forces and the Bangladeshi army, while emphasizing developmental cooperation, will be crucial for ensuring stability in the region. Hasina's downfall highlights the growing influence of popular unrest on political outcomes in South Asia.

The article argues that the US-backed political upheaval in Bangladesh, leading to the removal of Sheikh Hasina, is a strategic blunder. It suggests that the US, fixated on promoting democracy even in contexts where it may be detrimental, overlooked the potential consequences of destabilizing Bangladesh.  

The author contends that this instability benefits Pakistan and China, who are now poised to gain influence in the region.  The instability in Bangladesh is seen as a major security threat to India, particularly its northeastern states and West Bengal. The article concludes by warning India to be vigilant against potential CIA-backed destabilization efforts within its own borders.

The fall of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's government in Bangladesh raises concerns about India's security. The new political forces, Jamaat-e-Islami and Bangladesh National Party (BNP), are anti-secular and potentially aligned with Pakistan's interests. There are also reports of US involvement in the regime change, possibly motivated by strategic considerations in the Indo-Pacific region. This development adds to India's existing challenges with China and Pakistan, creating a hostile environment on its eastern border.

The recent turmoil in Bangladesh has triggered fears of another refugee crisis in West Bengal. West Bengal, which shares a long border with Bangladesh, has historically absorbed waves of migrants, though this continuous influx puts a strain on the state's resources and infrastructure. 

The arrival of refugees can lead to demographic shifts, increased competition for jobs, and pressure on public services like healthcare and education. This can exacerbate existing social and economic tensions, particularly regarding religion and communal harmony.

While Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has expressed a willingness to welcome refugees, this approach is being criticized as potentially risky and unsustainable. 

Concerns include the potential strain on West Bengal's already dense population, the impact on the state's economy, and the risk of increased communal tensions and security threats. 


A more pragmatic and cautious approach is being advocated, emphasizing the need for coordination between the state and central governments, as well as with the international community, to address the root causes of the unrest in Bangladesh and manage the refugee crisis effectively.

In Bangladesh, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned amidst significant civil unrest that began as protests against a reinstated quota system for government jobs but escalated to encompass broader issues like economic instability and corruption.  The unrest resulted in numerous casualties and led to demands for accountability from the government. Hasina's departure comes as a setback for India, which viewed her pro-India stance and close strategic partnership as crucial in a region marked by shifting loyalties and China's growing influence. Concerns now arise that external forces, particularly China, may capitalize on the situation to weaken India's standing in the region.

The article discusses a letter signed by some Indian citizens calling for the cancellation of arms export licences to Israel amidst the ongoing conflict with Hamas. The author argues that stopping these exports would harm India's budding military-industrial complex, which has seen significant growth under the "Make in India" initiative. 

The author points out that India's defense exports have reached record levels and that the sector generates employment and contributes to research and development.  They also highlight the strategic partnership between India and Israel in defense, noting that Israel is a valuable technology partner for India's growing defense sector. The author criticizes the letter signatories for selectively raising moral concerns while ignoring similar issues involving China and Pakistan, suggesting that their motives may be driven by opposition to India's increasing defense capabilities rather than genuine concern for peace.

Darrin McMahon's "Equality" explores the complex and evolving concept of equality throughout history. From ancient societies to modern movements, McMahon analyzes how different civilizations have grappled with ideas of equality, often in contradictory ways.  While ideals of equality have inspired transformative movements like the Civil Rights Movement, McMahon argues that achieving true equality is an ongoing struggle. He highlights the inherent tension between the human capacity for cooperation and our tendency towards hierarchy and dominance. McMahon emphasizes that the pursuit of equality requires constant vigilance and a willingness to challenge systems of inequality.  

He concludes that while true equality may be elusive, the human imagination's capacity to envision it remains a powerful force.

India's intentions regarding Quad are complex and multifaceted. Recent meetings between Indian and Chinese officials have fueled speculation about a possible thaw in bilateral relations, leading some to question India's commitment to Quad. 

However, India's cautious engagement with China, including restricting Chinese FDI and focusing on border infrastructure development, reflects a strategic stance aimed at balancing China's growing influence in the region. Quad, while evolving to address a broader global agenda, remains a crucial part of this balancing act.

India is concurrently deepening its security and economic ties with Southeast Asian nations, directly countering China's assertiveness in the South China Sea. This multi-pronged approach, encompassing plurilateral, multilateral, and bilateral frameworks, demonstrates India's commitment to regional stability without forcing Southeast Asian nations to choose sides in a great power conflict. This nuanced strategy, while overlooked by some in the West, highlights India's preference for a multi-dimensional approach to regional security.

The assassination of Ismail Haniyeh presents Iran with a difficult dilemma. While the Islamic Republic feels compelled to respond to protect its stability and regional influence, it lacks the resources for a direct confrontation with Israel and a potential US intervention. Iran's weakened economy, strained by sanctions, further limits its options.  Instead, it is likely to escalate actions through proxies in Lebanon and elsewhere, potentially resorting to targeted missile attacks.  While a full-scale war is not in Iran's interest, the high-stakes situation fueled by Israel's nuclear threat and potential miscalculation leaves the region vulnerable. Iran is facing a complex challenge in balancing its desire for retaliation with the realities of its diminished capabilities.

Exercise Pitch Black 2024, a major international air combat training event hosted by the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), took place from July 12 to August 2 in Darwin and Tindal, Northern Territory. This year's edition, the largest in its 43-year history, involved 20 nations, over 140 aircraft, and 4435 personnel.  The Indian Air Force (IAF) participated with Su-30 MKI fighters, C-17 Globemaster III transport aircraft, and IL-78 Air-to-Air Refuelling aircraft. 

The exercise focused on large-force employment, including air-to-air combat, air-to-surface strikes, and offensive and defensive counter-air operations. Participants gained valuable experience engaging with advanced aircraft like the F-22 Raptor and F-35 Lightning II. 

Pitch Black 2024 underscored the importance of multinational cooperation for regional security and provided IAF with a valuable opportunity to enhance interoperability and refine combat doctrines in a realistic combat environment.

The US's recent support for Tibet, including the signing of the 'Resolve Tibet Act,' highlights a shift in the country's approach to China.  Historically, Tibet functioned as a sovereign state, possessing the necessary attributes of a nation, even entering into agreements with powerful Chinese dynasties. China's forceful occupation of Tibet in 1950-51,  subsequently disrupting peaceful India-Tibet relations, is widely recognized as an act of aggression. In light of  China's ongoing expansionist agenda and betrayal of India's security interests, it is argued that India should adopt a more assertive stance. This includes recognizing the Tibetan Government in Exile, supporting international efforts for Tibetan autonomy, and realigning diplomatic relations to reflect the realities on the ground. Ultimately, supporting Tibet's self-determination is seen as crucial for safeguarding India's own national security.

This article discusses the political climate in France amidst the 2024 Summer Olympics.  President Macron's decision to dissolve the National Assembly and call snap elections has resulted in political instability, described as "chienlit," a term for chaos. 

Despite this, the Olympics opening ceremony received praise for its innovative displays and highlighting female heroes. However, a controversial portrayal of Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last Supper" featuring drag queen disciples drew criticism and accusations of blasphemy.

Macron, facing  a fractured parliament, is seeking a new prime minister who can bridge the political divide. He acknowledges his majority lost the election but remains determined to navigate this complex situation.  The article concludes by comparing France's political challenges to General de Gaulle's famous quote about the country's diverse cheese varieties.

This article explores the historical and cultural complexities of Mewat, a region in northwestern India encompassing parts of Haryana, Rajasthan, and Uttar Pradesh. 

The region has a history marked by conflict, violence, and forced religious conversions dating back to the 13th century under Sultan Balban. 

Despite attempts to force conformity, the Meos, the region's dominant population, have retained elements of their original Rajput identity and customs. The region today faces challenges of underdevelopment, crime, and extremist ideologies, with the Tablighi Jamaat's influence contributing to a rise in orthodoxy. 

The author highlights instances of mixed cultural expressions, like the Octagonal tomb in Tijara, which locals refer to as a temple dedicated to a Hindu king.  

While violence erupted in Nuh in 2023, a recent instance of communal harmony during a religious procession offers a glimmer of hope for a more peaceful future.   The article concludes by emphasizing the need for inspired leadership and collective effort to overcome the region's challenges.

The ongoing war in Ukraine, approaching its 900-day mark, has resulted in devastating consequences.  Thousands of civilian and military personnel have been killed or wounded, millions displaced, and the country's infrastructure severely damaged.  Despite significant military aid from the West, the conflict shows no signs of abating, with Ukraine seeking more advanced weaponry and Russia holding firm.  A potential peace deal negotiated in early 2022 collapsed, allegedly due to opposition from the US and UK.

While India has maintained cordial ties with Ukraine, providing humanitarian aid and facilitating student evacuations, its relationship with Russia remains a key consideration. Prime Minister Modi's upcoming visit to Ukraine is shrouded in mystery, with questions about its purpose and potential outcomes.  

Diplomatic efforts to end the conflict have been largely unsuccessful, raising concerns that the situation may worsen.  It remains unclear whether Prime Minister Modi's visit will achieve any tangible results or contribute to a meaningful resolution.

The assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran has heightened tensions in the region.  While Israel has made strides in targeting Hamas and Hezbollah leaders, the killing of Haniyeh risks further escalation.  Iran, facing humiliation and calls for revenge from its leaders, is expected to respond through its proxies, such as Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Houthis. 

The international community is concerned about a wider conflict and is working to de-escalate the situation. However,  Israel's actions, driven by a desire to eliminate the threat from Iran and its allies, continue to raise the risk of a major war.  The situation remains volatile, with both sides maneuvering for strategic advantage and facing pressure from international actors to avoid a catastrophic conflict.

The World Bank's 2024 Development Report highlights the "middle-income trap," where countries struggle to reach high-income status.  The report warns that 108 middle-income countries, including India, face significant challenges in escaping this trap. 

It suggests a "3i" strategy: investments, infusion of technology, and innovation. While investing and technology infusion are recommended for low and lower-middle-income countries, upper middle-income countries like India are urged to prioritize all three "i's," particularly innovation and research and development to leverage their demographic dividend and human capital.

The report acknowledges India's specific challenges, including socio-economic inequality and the need for robust institutional development.  While recognizing the potential inherent in India's youth, the report emphasizes the need for inclusive growth and leveraging the "public-private-academia" convergence to achieve "Vikisit Bharat" by 2047.

The Israeli Defence Forces (IDF) achieved several decisive victories in conventional wars during the latter half of the 20th century.  After the 1973 Yom Kippur War, however, the nature of conflict shifted.  The rise of Iranian-backed proxies like Hezbollah and Hamas brought about a new era of "forever in war" characterized by terrorism and asymmetric warfare. 

The IDF, accustomed to conventional tactics, struggled to adapt to these new challenges.  They have faced repeated setbacks, most prominently in 2006 against Hezbollah and the ongoing conflict with Hamas in Gaza.  This failure to craft a winning strategy has led to high civilian casualties and questionable tactics.  The author suggests that Israel's military approach has become too focused on violence, neglecting diplomacy and efforts to isolate terrorists within their own societies.  In contrast, India's approach to proxy warfare, while acknowledging the constant threat from adversaries, emphasizes pragmatic solutions and conflict termination.

The Kargil war in 1999 exposed Pakistan's miscalculations in its military strategy against India.  Historical context shows Pakistan repeatedly engaging in wars it couldn't win, using pretexts like Kashmir to justify conflicts and maintain its military's relevance. Despite acquiring nuclear weapons in 1998, Pakistan underestimated India's resolve, misjudging that the nuclear deterrent would prevent a counteroffensive. 

Pakistan's failed military campaigns, including Kargil, have consistently resulted in political turmoil. Ayub Khan, though victorious in 1965, faced backlash and lost his position. Yahya Khan, humiliated in 1971, was forced out, and Pervez Musharraf's Kargil operation led to the downfall of Nawaz Sharif. These instances demonstrate a clear correlation between military misadventures against India and the collapse of Pakistani leadership.

India faces a significant issue of youth unemployment despite economic growth.  Various government initiatives aim to address this, including funding for small businesses, vocational training, and rural employment schemes. However, the effectiveness of these schemes remains unclear due to a lack of reliable data. Recent studies reveal alarming unemployment rates, especially among educated youth.  While some progress has been made in reducing extreme poverty among youth, vulnerability remains high due to a significant portion of youth employed in the informal sector under poor conditions.  

The government's focus should be on bridging skill gaps, ensuring secure employment, and reducing vulnerable work participation. Successful international models like the European Union's Youth Guarantee scheme can provide inspiration. India could implement a similar program at the district level, coordinating existing skill development and employment schemes to offer comprehensive support to youth seeking gainful employment or entrepreneurship.

The Indian Ocean Region, despite its militarization, remains relatively peaceful. China, however, is increasing its presence through various means, including naval deployments, dual-use infrastructure projects, and fishing activities. This has raised concerns about China’s intentions and its potential to exert influence over smaller nations in the region. 

India, on the other hand, pursues a trust-based approach, focusing on capacity-building, humanitarian assistance, and regional cooperation initiatives. However, India's democratic processes and slower decision-making can hinder its effectiveness compared to China's more assertive model. 
  
To counter China's growing influence, India needs to accelerate its engagement and demonstrate its commitment to the region through concrete actions and tangible benefits. Building trust and forging strong partnerships with its maritime neighbors is crucial for India to successfully implement its 'Neighbourhood First' policy and maintain a balance of power in the Indian Ocean.

Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh was killed in a suspected Israeli strike in Tehran, following a pattern of assassinations targeting Hamas' leadership.  Haniyeh, despite being the organization's international face and advocating for negotiations with Israel, played a significant role in the recent escalation of violence.  

His death is unlikely to cripple Hamas as it follows a structure designed to replace leaders, with senior members like Khaled Mashal and Yahya Sinwar, the Gaza leader, considered as potential successors. Sinwar, known for his ruthlessness, has earned the nickname "The Butcher of Khan Younis" and was last seen in a video emerging from a tunnel complex. 

The article details other prominent Hamas figures who have also been eliminated by Israel over the years, emphasizing Hamas' ability to regenerate its leadership despite these losses. It concludes that the cycle of violence will likely continue as Hamas demonstrates resilience and adapts to new leadership.

### [Netanyahu seeks total war: Hezbollah is a sideshow, Iran is the real target](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/netanyahu-seeks-total-war-hezbollah-is-a-sideshow-iran-is-the-real-target-13799944.html)

Israel is escalating its conflict with Iran and its proxies, demonstrating a willingness to conduct targeted assassinations and airstrikes deep within enemy territory. 

While these actions aim to weaken Hezbollah and Hamas, they risk provoking a wider conflict, particularly with Iran. Israel's strategy appears to be driven by a desire to force Iran's reaction, potentially justifying a strike on Iran's nuclear facilities.  This aggressive posture, while projecting strength, lacks a clear strategic endgame and could lead to unforeseen consequences.  The perpetuation of conflict also serves Netanyahu's political interests by consolidating his base and diverting attention from domestic issues.

### [How Ismail Haniyeh’s killing may weaken Hamas but not its ideology](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-ismail-haniyehs-killing-may-weaken-hamas-but-not-its-ideology-13799756.html)

Recently, Ismail Haniyeh, the top leader of Hamas, was killed in an attack in Tehran. Hamas blamed Israel for the attack, while Israel celebrated the event. Haniyeh was a key figure in Hamas' political operations and was involved in ceasefire negotiations with Israel. His death has been met with anger by Palestinians, and there are concerns that it could lead to a further escalation of the conflict.  The assassination is a significant blow to Hamas, but the group's ideology is unlikely to change, and it remains committed to its goals, including the liberation of Jerusalem. 


The killing has sparked international concern, with some urging Israel to pursue a diplomatic solution and avoid further violence.  Ultimately, the consequences of Haniyeh's death remain to be seen, but the situation in the region is highly volatile.

### [From Ukraine to Armenia, drones take centre stage in modern warfare](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/from-ukraine-to-armenia-drones-take-centre-stage-in-modern-warfare-13799697.html)

Drones have significantly changed modern warfare, offering precision, surveillance, and operational flexibility.  Cost-effective compared to manned aircraft, they've been instrumental in conflicts like Nagorno-Karabakh and the Russia-Ukraine war. Technological advancements allow for secure control and precise strikes,  making drones a powerful tool. However, the rise of AI in warfare, particularly Lethal Autonomous Weapon Systems (LAWS), raises serious ethical concerns. LAWS can identify, select, and engage targets without human intervention, leading to questions about accountability and the potential for unintended harm. International discussions aim to regulate these systems, but achieving consensus is challenging due to differing national interests and the ambiguity surrounding LAWS definitions.

### [Why US-Japan-South Korea trilateral partnership will withstand the test of time](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-us-japan-south-korea-trilateral-partnership-will-withstand-the-test-of-time-13799676.html)

The US, Japan, and South Korea recently formalized their trilateral security cooperation with a historic memorandum signed by their defense ministers. This move comes amidst growing regional tensions,  particularly  North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, the increasing US-China rivalry, and a more assertive China in the East and South China Seas. 

The agreement outlines key areas of cooperation, including real-time data sharing on North Korean missile launches, joint military drills, and enhanced intelligence sharing. This strengthens the security umbrella for all three countries and aims to deter North Korean aggression.  The trilateral cooperation also reflects a shared commitment to maintaining peace and stability in the Indo-Pacific region.

### [India–China ‘de-escalation’: New progress or new normal?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/india-china-de-escalation-new-progress-or-new-normal-13799546.html)

Recent meetings and statements between Indian and Chinese officials highlight the ongoing tensions surrounding the India-China border dispute. While discussions on maintaining peace and making progress have taken place, China's actions, including the construction of a bridge near the Line of Actual Control, raise concerns. 

Historically, China has prioritized its strategic and economic interests during border negotiations, and its current focus on maritime security, coupled with the militarization of its borders, adds complexity to the situation. India must remain vigilant and firm in asserting its position, preventing any "new progress" by China from becoming the "new normal" in this contested region.

Prime Minister Pham Minh Chinh's visit to India aims to further strengthen the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership established in 2016.  The two countries have witnessed a significant increase in bilateral trade, and defense cooperation is a key focus. India gifted a warship to Vietnam in 2023, demonstrating its commitment to deepening ties. Discussions during the visit are expected to include the acquisition of Indian BrahMos missiles and Akash surface-to-air missile systems. 

Beyond strategic interests, shared civilisational history and cultural connections contribute to the growing trust between India and Vietnam.  Both nations recognize the importance of multipolarity in the evolving global order and seek to build partnerships with like-minded powers to ensure lasting peace and security.

The recent Third Plenum of China's Communist Party, presided over by Xi Jinping, outlined the country's policy direction for the next five years.  The plenum emphasized a "new development philosophy" focused on high-quality growth driven by education, innovation, and technological self-sufficiency.  Economic reforms aimed at strengthening the socialist market economy while maintaining state control were also highlighted, along with a commitment to green energy and fiscal reforms.  National security received significant attention, underscoring the Party's commitment to strengthening its control over the military and defense capabilities. 

The plenum's focus on state control and national security, coupled with the current economic slowdown, has raised concerns both domestically and internationally about the direction of China's future.

### [Why US policies fail to resonate with Arab public opinion](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-us-policies-fail-to-resonate-with-arab-public-opinion-13799262.html)

Decades of US involvement in the Middle East, characterized by aid and military alliances, have not earned widespread Arab support. US policies often clash with regional sentiments, particularly its stance on Israel, leading to distrust.  

The US has struggled to define clear goals and adapt to shifting dynamics, such as Iran's growing influence in Iraq. The frustration with US policies allows authoritarian regimes to manipulate public opinion by linking conflicts with the Palestinian cause. US interventions, perceived as heavy-handed and contributing to instability and refugee crises, further fuel anti-American sentiment. Iran and its allies amplify these grievances through propaganda, solidifying their position while US actions damage its credibility.  

China's increasing diplomatic engagement in the Middle East, epitomized by its role in mediating conflicts, contrasts with the US's inconsistent approach and benefits China's popularity. The US faces a challenge maintaining its influence as regional powers seek diverse partnerships amid a shifting geopolitical landscape.

The Artemis program, led by NASA, aims to establish a permanent human presence on the moon.  This involves landing the first woman and person of color on the lunar surface by 2026, and building a lunar space station called "Gateway" by 2027.

The program seeks to utilize lunar resources like water and rare minerals, potentially powering rockets and future space exploration.  Forty-three countries, including India, have signed the Artemis Accords, a set of principles for sustainable and transparent space activities.  

While the US, with partners like SpaceX and Boeing, leads the initiative, China is also advancing its own lunar program focusing on resource exploration and utilization.  Artemis is seen as a stepping stone for future human missions to Mars and beyond.

The recent Quad foreign ministers' meeting in Tokyo emphasized several key points.

Firstly, while India holds the chair this year, hosting responsibilities are flexible and driven by convenience, prioritizing pre-existing convenings. 

Secondly, implementation of Quad initiatives, including those in the IORA region, Pacific Islands, and ASEAN, remains crucial, with a focus on disaster resilience,  digital economy, and critical emerging technologies.

Thirdly, strategic challenges, particularly China's influence in the South China Sea, dominated discussions. The Quad supports ASEAN centrality and a robust code of conduct with China but remains concerned by China's actions.

Fourthly, attention shifted from the Ukraine crisis to the Gaza conflict, with all four members advocating for peace. 

Finally, the Quad balances its work towards regional good with military coordination to address regional issues, reflecting India's nuanced approach - strategic congruence without formal coalition membership.

### [Why India needs to balance security concerns with neighbours’ sovereign considerations](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-india-needs-to-balance-security-concerns-with-neighbours-sovereign-considerations-13798861.html)

This article discusses India's approach to its regional security concerns and its interactions with neighboring countries, particularly in the context of China's growing influence. 

India's "Neighbourhood First" policy aims to build strong ties with its neighbors based on people-centric interactions rather than personality-driven ones. While India addresses regional security concerns, it faces criticism from neighboring nations for expecting them to align with its security perceptions without sufficient consultation.

The article highlights instances where India's actions have  caused friction with its neighbors, such as its defense agreements with countries like the US and pressure on them regarding China. 

Despite these challenges, the author suggests that the Colombo Security Conclave (CSC) offers a platform for collective security dialogue and building trust among Indian Ocean rim nations, ultimately mitigating external influence and fostering a more cooperative regional security environment.

### [Unravelling the complexity of ADHD](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/adhd-numbers-are-rising-alarmingly-unravelling-the-complexity-of-attention-deficit-hyperactivity-disorder-13798850.html)

ADHD is often diagnosed alongside other mental health conditions. Studies show that a large percentage of individuals with ADHD also experience conditions like anxiety, depression, and oppositional defiance disorder. These co-existing conditions can exacerbate each other and lead to challenges in daily life.  

One reason for this overlap is that symptoms of ADHD and other conditions can be similar, potentially leading to misdiagnosis.  Additionally,  genetic factors may contribute to the link between ADHD and conditions like autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  

Recognizing the complexity of these co-existing conditions is crucial for effective treatment.  A combined approach involving medication, therapy, and lifestyle changes can help manage symptoms and improve overall well-being.

### [Why India can’t afford not to engage with junta in Myanmar](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-india-cant-afford-not-to-engage-with-junta-in-myanmar-13798768.html)

India's relationship with Myanmar's military junta is complex and fraught with challenges.  While the junta's grip on power weakens, it remains a crucial ally for India due to its volatile region, porous border, and influence from Chinese-backed militias. India supports the junta primarily for strategic reasons, including counterbalancing China's influence, ensuring regional stability for initiatives like BIMSTEC, and tackling the narcotics trade.  

Despite ethical concerns, India believes engagement with Mynamar is necessary and seeks a diplomatic path towards a future democratic framework. This delicate balancing act requires a combination of pragmatism and principle, as India navigates the complexities of Myanmar's situation.

### [The many diplomatic nuances of PM Modi’s expected visit to Ukraine](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/the-many-diplomatic-nuances-of-pm-modis-expected-visit-to-ukraine-13798785.html)

Prime Minister Modi's potential visit to Ukraine stems from several factors.  Ukraine desires international sympathy for its plight, and a visit from a major non-Western nation like India would be significant. India, with its close ties to Russia, has been urged to play a mediating role in the conflict.

Modi's recent visit to Russia angered the US, prompting India to consider this visit as a gesture of peace and diplomacy to Zelenskyy. This visit could also strengthen India's position on the world stage, counterbalancing China's involvement in peace initiatives.

India supports a peaceful resolution to the conflict and  acknowledges existing mediation efforts by countries like China. Modi's visit, therefore, could be seen as a continuation of India's diplomatic efforts to find a solution that satisfies all parties involved.

### [Biden’s ‘coup for a coup’ to avenge his ouster from White House race](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bidens-coup-for-a-coup-to-avenge-his-ouster-from-white-house-race-13798622.html)

Joe Biden's decision to drop out of the 2024 presidential race came after a series of setbacks, including a disastrous debate performance against Donald Trump and declining poll numbers.  

Facing pressure from within his own party, including high-profile Democrats who wanted him to step aside, Biden ultimately conceded defeat. He claimed his decision was made in the "defense of democracy" and to "pass the torch to a new generation," endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement. 

Despite his stated reasons, Biden's move was widely seen as a face-saving attempt after his fitness for office was increasingly questioned.  Several polls indicated that alternative Democratic candidates, including Harris, were performing better against Trump. 

Biden's endorsement of Harris was seen by some as a strategic move to avoid an open nomination process that could have threatened party unity and led to a more contested race. 

While Harris now holds the Democratic nomination, many remain skeptical of her ability to defeat Trump in the general election.

Tarun Tahiliani has defended his designs for the Indian contingent at the Paris Olympics, emphasizing that they are not meant to be haute couture.  Despite criticism about the use of digital prints instead of traditional weaves, Tahiliani maintains that the designs represent modern India and acknowledges the team’s preference for wearing what they are familiar with. 

He further states that the uniforms have received positive feedback from industrialists and believes the different perspectives are natural. The designer stands by his choices, emphasizing that the focus should be on the athletes' performance rather than the aesthetics of the uniforms.

This article outlines a multifaceted strategy for India to counter Pakistan's terrorism. It emphasizes strengthening security at infiltration points, particularly along the Jammu and Punjab border, and reviving human intelligence networks (HUMINT). 

The author argues for a community outreach program to address alienation and concerns of various groups. Cracking down on Islamist outfits, reviving Village Defence Committees, and dismantling local support systems are also deemed crucial.  A "carrot and stick" policy is proposed, incentivizing patriotism while applying tough measures against extremists. 

The article concludes by advocating for strong diplomatic pressure on Pakistan, leveraging India's economic and military advantages, and potentially escalating to military action as a last resort to demonstrate the high cost of terrorism.

Both sides agreed to hold an "early meeting" of the Working Mechanism on Consultation and Coordination on India-China Border Affairs (WMCC) to further discuss border issues. 

While previous attempts at de-escalation have seen limited success, both countries expressed hope for a swift resolution to the standoff, which has negatively impacted their bilateral relations.

### [No ‘Viksit Bharat’ without unleashing Green Revolution 2.0](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/no-viksit-bharat-without-unleashing-green-revolution-2-0-13798327.html)

The focus should shift from discussions about capital gains tax to foundational reforms that benefit the majority of Indians. India's economic growth, while impressive, hasn't trickled down effectively, leading to significant income disparity. 

Agriculture, crucial for a large portion of the population, requires urgent attention.  Investments in technology, infrastructure, and research are needed to boost productivity and income for farmers.  

Subsidies, while seemingly helpful, primarily benefit consumers, not farmers.  Additionally, the government must consider a negotiated Minimum Support Price (MSP) system to incentivize crop diversification and provide basic income security.

Boosting agricultural incomes will have a positive ripple effect on the entire economy, especially the consumer market in rural India. Policymakers must prioritize reforms in agriculture, health and education to ensure a more equitable and prosperous society.

### [Trump 2.0: What it may mean for India-US relations](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/trump-2-0-what-it-may-mean-for-india-us-relations-13798240.html)

A potential second Trump presidency could significantly impact India's relationship with the US. While Trump's economic nationalism might hurt Indian exporters through tariffs, it could also lead to increased US investment in India as companies seek alternatives to China.  Migration policies are expected to be stricter, potentially impacting Indian IT professionals, students, and families seeking visas. 

However, defense and military cooperation could further strengthen, benefiting India through technology sharing, arms sales, and strategic alignment against China in the Indo-Pacific.  India's shared interests with the US in countering Chinese influence and terrorism could also lead to closer collaboration.  Ultimately, the nature of the relationship will depend on strategic diplomacy and actions taken by both countries.

Tarun Tahiliani's Olympic uniforms for the Indian contingent faced sharp criticism for their unflattering design and lack of creativity.  Ace badminton player Jwala Gutta highlighted the impracticality of the sarees for athletes, pointing out the discomfort and lack of pre-draped options.  She also criticized the choice of colors and print, arguing that they didn't represent the beauty of Indian culture.  Many felt Tahiliani, known for his expertise in other areas, did not do justice to the ikat weave, which could have been showcased more effectively.  Critics compared the uniforms to cheap imitations found in local markets, lamenting the missed opportunity to represent India with a truly magnificent ensemble.

### [‘Counter disinformation’ or betraying trust? US embassy’s meddling in India’s domestic politics deserves greater scrutiny](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/us-embassy-meddling-in-indias-domestic-politics-india-us-relation-13798149.html)

This article discusses the US's attempt to influence India's domestic politics through seemingly benign initiatives. 

It argues that while the US emphasizes a partnership of equals, its actions, particularly those undertaken by the US embassy in India,  reveal a deeper agenda. The author highlights a workshop on "impactful content" hosted by the embassy, led by controversial figures linked to organizations with ties to the US deep state. 

The article suggests these efforts, framed as countering disinformation, are actually attempts to manipulate public discourse and weaken the ruling BJP party, which the US views as a challenge to its liberal hegemony. 

Further, it draws parallels to the Biden administration's alleged censorship of dissenting voices on social media platforms, implying that the US is employing similar tactics in India.  The author concludes by expressing concern that these actions undermine the trust between the two nations, despite their proclaimed strategic partnership.

### [Hamas-Fatah deal: Truth behind China’s role as ‘global peace mediator’](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/hamas-fatah-deal-truth-behind-chinas-role-as-global-peace-mediator-13797990.html)

China recently brokered a peace agreement between Palestinian factions, including Hamas and Fatah, in Beijing. The agreement, welcomed by China and some factions, calls for a unified Palestinian government once war in Gaza ends. However, critics argue that the agreement is superficial and overlooks the deep distrust between the factions.  

China's media is portraying this as a major diplomatic achievement, highlighting its role in mediating the Saudi-Iran rapprochement and suggesting its potential involvement in other conflicts. However, critics point out that the Saudi-Iran detente has yet to yield substantial results, and that China's support for Hamas and other groups designated as terrorists by many countries raises questions about its true intentions. 

Some Indian commentators are also lauding China's peacemaking efforts, but critics argue that this overlooks China's own support for terrorism and its double standards on the issue.

A new study by the Wildlife Institute of India has revealed that house sparrow populations in the Uttarakhand Himalayas migrate along with the local villagers.  The sparrows leave the high-altitude villages when villagers move to lower elevations for winter and return with them in the summer. This  demonstrates a strong bond between the birds and humans.  The study also found that sparrows living at higher altitudes are larger in size due to adaptations to the cold climate. Researchers are using bird banding to track the sparrows' movements and learn more about their nesting habits and food sources in these challenging environments.

The Olympic Games, dating back to ancient Greece,  remain a significant global event despite changing times. The Games promote sportsmanship and the pursuit of athletic excellence, transcending cultural and political boundaries. 

They have historically facilitated dialogue and reconciliation between nations, as seen in instances like the participation of South Africa in 1992 and the marching of North and South Korea under one flag in 2000. 

Beyond their symbolic value, the Olympics provide economic benefits to host countries, boost tourism, and raise global awareness of diverse sports.  The cyclical nature of the Games, supported by sponsors, media, and fans, generates substantial revenue that is largely reinvested in the Olympic movement, ensuring its continued legacy.

The Resolve Tibet Bill, signed into law by US President Joe Biden, expresses bipartisan support for Tibetan human rights and recognizes the historical inaccuracies of China's claims of Tibet's ancient ties to the country.  

The bill, however, reiterates the US's "One-China Policy," potentially undermining its effectiveness in achieving genuine autonomy for Tibet.  China vehemently protests the bill, reaffirming Tibet's status as an "inalienable part" of China. The Dalai Lama advocates for a middle-way approach, seeking autonomy within China, while emphasizing the need for international law and recognition of Tibet's historical status as an independent state.  There are concerns over increasing repression in Tibet, including the recent closure of a prominent Tibetan vocational high school.  India, with its ongoing border dispute with China, has a crucial role to play in any future negotiations regarding Tibet's fate.  Observers believe that Tibetans should consider India as a key partner in their discussions with China.

### [Chinese checkers in West Asia: Why peace remains elusive in Gaza](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/chinese-checkers-in-west-asia-why-peace-remains-elusive-in-gaza-13797760.html)

The recent developments in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, marked by China hosting Palestinian factions and Netanyahu's address in Washington, highlight contrasting approaches to peace. 

China, seeking to position itself as a mediator, is working towards Palestinian unity, aiming for a unified approach under the PLO. This while Israel, led by Netanyahu, continues to focus on security concerns and firmly opposes any handover of Gaza to Hamas.  The US, though officially supporting the Two-State Solution, has faced challenges in achieving progress due to intransigence on both sides. 

While Netanyahu successfully garnered support in the US Congress by emphasizing Israel’s security needs, Senator Sanders remained critical of both Netanyahu and US policies. 

China's efforts could potentially shift the balance, but achieving a lasting peace remains a complex challenge demanding nuanced solutions and compromise from all involved parties.

India's FY 2024-25 defence budget stands at Rs. 6.21 lakh crore, a slight decrease compared to the interim budget. Despite this, it remains the highest allocation among all ministries at 13% of the total budget.  New Delhi aims to boost domestic defence manufacturing and reduce reliance on imports. 

Recent years have seen a push towards indigenisation with over 12,300 items already localised. India's defence exports reached Rs. 21,083 crore in FY 2023-24, a significant increase. The government aims to raise military hardware exports to Rs. 50,000 crore by 2028-29. 



Experts suggest increasing the defence budget to at least 25% of the total expenditure to meet the country's security challenges, including those posed by China and regional instability. The author also highlights the need to separate pay allowances and pensions from the core defence budget for better allocation and growth in the sector.

Pakistan continues to promote terrorism against India while facing its own internal security challenges.  Despite facing economic difficulties and a resurgence of terrorism in regions like Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan, Pakistan remains committed to using terrorism as a tool against India. 

Recent terrorist attacks in Pakistan have highlighted the country's internal security struggles. This, however, hasn't deterred Pakistan from its anti-India stance. Army officials, while emphasizing their ongoing efforts against terrorists, have also raised concerns about the negative impact of "digital terrorism" and accused India of seeking to exploit Pakistan's vulnerabilities.  Despite India's increasing focus on China as a strategic rival, Pakistan continues to view India as its primary concern. Experts argue that normalizing relations with India is crucial for Pakistan's future, as its ongoing enmity with India hinders its economic, social, and political progress.

China is expanding its surveillance and suppression of Muslims, starting with practices in Xinjiang and now targeting the Hui community in mainland China. This campaign, called "Sinification," aims to diminish cultural and religious distinctions among minorities and promote a unified national identity. The tactics include restricting religious practices, monitoring youth, and forbidding headscarves for civil servants. This escalation follows a pattern of previous persecution of Uyghurs in Xinjiang, where over a million have been detained in "re-education camps" and subjected to indoctrination, torture, and forced renunciations of their faith.  Despite the human rights abuses, China deflects criticism by leveraging its economic power and investments in Muslim-majority nations.  The international community must hold China accountable not only through words but also through concrete actions that support the Uyghur people's rights to freedom and dignity.

Student-led protests erupted in Bangladesh following the Supreme Court’s reinstatement of a controversial 30% quota for government jobs reserved for descendants of 1971 Liberation War freedom fighters. 

The protests, which have turned violent, leading to deaths and injuries, demand the permanent scrapping of the quota system and accountability from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The government responded with internet shutdowns, mobile network restrictions, and curfews, while also detaining prominent protesters and opposition leaders. 

The protests have impacted trade between India and Bangladesh, prompting the Indian government to advise its nationals and facilitate the return of over 4,500 Indians. India has also heightened security along its border with Bangladesh amid concerns about spillover effects. The situation has raised questions about the future of Bangladesh's internal stability and its relationship with India, particularly in light of China’s growing influence in the region.

The Kargil conflict serves as a prototype for India's potential future battlefield scenario against China. The conflict highlighted weaknesses in India's intelligence gathering and preparedness, particularly regarding Pakistan's infiltration plans. Despite initial setbacks and losses, the Indian Air Force (IAF) adapted its strategy, utilizing precision bombing techniques with laser-guided bombs and achieving decisive victories. 

The Kargil War led to a comprehensive review of India's national security apparatus, resulting in the establishment of several key institutions and upgrades to military capabilities.  

India faces a significant challenge in closing its military capability gap with China, especially in air power.  While China is rapidly modernizing its military, India has experience operating in high-altitude environments and has been actively upgrading its fleet of fighter jets, transport aircraft, and missile systems. To effectively counter potential Chinese aggression, India must further strengthen its ISR capabilities, expand its fighter squadron strength, improve air defense systems, and invest in a robust drone fleet.

Protests in Bangladesh over a reinstated quota system, which reserves government jobs for certain groups, have escalated into violence, leaving over 150 dead. The protests began after the High Court reinstated the quota system, but the Supreme Court later suspended the order.  

The situation has been inflamed by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's use of the term "Razakar" – a derogatory term for those who sided with Pakistan during Bangladesh's independence war – to describe the protestors, who are mostly students. 

The protests have presented an opportunity for the Opposition to criticize Sheikh Hasina's government, and many Opposition leaders have been arrested.  The resurgence of Jamaat-e-Islami, a proscribed outfit with transnational links and opposition to Bangladesh's creation, has raised concerns about the potential threat to regional peace and security.  

India, meanwhile, is watching the developments closely, concerned about the potential impact on its own security and its Act East Policy.

The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the India, Middle East, Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC) are major economic initiatives that reflect the changing global power dynamics. China's BRI aims to reshape the global order, while the US-backed IMEEC seeks to counter China's influence.  

The rise of China and its economic ambitions have led to a shift in international relations, with the US employing strategies like IMEEC to maintain its hegemony. While both initiatives share goals of connectivity and economic growth, IMEEC might be more successful due to the US's democratic values, transparent financial sector, and global trust. Conversely, BRI faces accusations of debt-trap diplomacy and a lack of transparency.  India has positioned itself outside both frameworks, advocating for a more inclusive world order.

China's recent economic and political events highlight growing instability within the country. Although pushing for self-reliance and national security, China's export-driven economy faces resistance globally and weak domestic consumption. This, coupled with a struggling property market and persistent corruption in the military, raises concerns about China's future stability.  

Despite recent purges aimed at addressing corruption, the Chinese military appears to be compromised. The Belt and Road Initiative, once a symbol of China's global ambitions, is now facing backlash. While China attempts to maintain a facade of strength, its leadership faces serious challenges balancing economic growth with political control. This inward focus risks jeopardizing essential international partnerships and could ultimately stifle China's economic success.

### [Budget 2024: Constructive welfare and not sops is the mantra for Viksit Bharat](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/budget-2024-constructive-welfare-and-not-sops-is-the-mantra-for-viksit-bharat-13796108.html)

The budget focuses on a steady growth trajectory of 7% per year to achieve "Viksit Bharat" by 2047. It emphasizes a strong foundation through enabling measures rather than populist handouts. The government aims to improve farm income, youth skills, and create employment opportunities. The fiscal deficit is projected to be 4.9% of GDP, a commendable figure likely to attract foreign investment.  Tax on foreign companies has been reduced to match Indian domestic companies. 

Infrastructure allocation remains steady, and minor changes to personal income tax will benefit the middle class.  Capital gains tax adjustments, while minimal, raise concerns about future potential hikes. 

The focus on rural development, agriculture, and skilling is notable, with specific investments in natural farming, pulses and shrimp farming. The budget also aims to support the MSME sector and improve digital public infrastructure.

### [Budget 2024 lays blueprint for Viksit Bharat: Centre is facilitator, private sector, MSMEs drivers of growth](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/budget-2024-lays-blueprint-for-viksit-bharat-centre-is-facilitator-private-sector-msmes-drivers-of-growth-13796060.html)

The recent budget prioritizes government facilitation over direct financial responsibility.  Instead of grants or investments, the government aims to incentivize and guarantee, as seen with potential loans for Bihar and Andhra Pradesh. 

Similar approaches apply to youth employment, with incentives for employers and employees over direct job provision. The  MSME sector receives loan guarantee schemes.  To further illustrate this approach, the government’s new internship initiative involves no direct financial burden, instead relying on companies to utilise their CSR funds for training and allowances. This budget signals a shift towards facilitating growth rather than directly funding it.

### [Eco Survey 2024: Amid high growth India’s future appears bright, but a ‘grand alliance’ to tame unemployment is required](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/eco-survey-2024-amid-high-growth-indias-future-appears-bright-but-a-grand-alliance-to-tame-unemployment-is-required-13795928.html)

The Economic Survey of 2023-24 highlights both positive and concerning aspects of the Indian economy.  While the nation boasts a strong and stable economy, with projected growth between 6.5-7% and controlled inflation, there are significant challenges. Private sector capital formation remains slower than desired, foreign direct investment may face headwinds, and employment remains a concern. 

The survey acknowledges the lack of reliable data on job creation, which hinders a clear understanding of the labor market situation. It emphasizes the need for a "grand alliance" between the central government, state governments, and the private sector to address these challenges and promote sustained high growth.  This alliance would focus on boosting private sector job creation, particularly in manufacturing and services, and fostering innovation through collaboration between governments, the private sector, and academia.

### [US Sutra | Biden withdraws from presidential race, but road remains bumpy for Democrats](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/biden-withdraws-from-presidential-race-but-road-remains-bumpy-for-democrats-13795718.html)

US President Joe Biden unexpectedly announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor.  The decision came 100 days before the election, after calls from within the party for Biden to step down, and follows Donald Trump's announced candidacy and selection of JD Vance as his running mate. 

While Biden cited fulfilling his current duties as president as his reason for withdrawing, the move leaves Democrats scrambling to prepare for the November election. Harris, who will face scrutiny over her record and performance as vice president, is now the frontrunner but faces an uphill battle against the popular Trump.  
 
Many Democrats expressed disappointment with the late announcement, while Republicans seized the opportunity to attack Biden and his legacy. Trump, in particular, remained critical of the former president.  Despite the support of some Democrats, including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, the move has created uncertainty and divisions within the party.

### [Budget 2024 expectations: Empowering women farmers with technology to transform India's agricultural economy](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/budget-2024-empowering-women-farmers-with-technology-to-transform-indias-agricultural-economy-13795665.html)

This article stresses the importance of empowering women in agriculture through technology to achieve a more equitable and sustainable food system. It highlights the significant contributions of women in agriculture despite facing systemic barriers in accessing resources, technology, education, and financial services. 

The article argues that bridging the technological gap for women farmers is crucial for boosting productivity, increasing incomes, and ensuring their full participation in the agricultural sector's growth. It emphasizes the need for targeted policy interventions, including gender-sensitive credit facilities, training programs, and inclusive extension services, to address these disparities. The authors also advocate for increased women's representation in decision-making processes within agricultural institutions.

### [The horror of Razakars haunts Bangladesh again](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/the-horror-of-razakars-haunts-bangladesh-again-13795631.html)

Protests in Bangladesh over the quota system in government jobs have turned violent, resulting in numerous casualties and arson attacks. The High Court's decision to restore a quota for the families of freedom fighters sparked the unrest. 

The Supreme Court later reduced the quota, but protests continue, fueled by inflammatory rhetoric that invokes the term "Razakar," a derogatory term for pro-Pakistani collaborators during the 1971 Liberation War. 

Critics accuse the protesters of being politically motivated and aim to discredit the Awami League government. The violence spread beyond Bangladesh, with incidents reported in the UK and UAE.

A recent global IT disruption, affecting airlines, banks, and other sectors, was caused by a logical error in Crowdstrike's Falcon Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool. The error, stemming from a configuration file update, caused Windows systems to crash repeatedly, resulting in a widespread Blue Screen of Death (BSOD).  While EDR solutions are designed to protect against evolving cyber threats by monitoring for suspicious behaviors, the Crowdstrike incident highlights the critical need for rigorous quality checks in software development. A misstep in the kernel-level code of the EDR sensor triggered the system crashes, showcasing the potential for even seemingly minor errors to have cascading consequences. The incident serves as a reminder of the importance of balancing speed of deployment with stringent quality assurance, especially in critical IT infrastructure.

The ongoing wars in Eurasia and the Middle East highlight the failure of the international rules-based order. The International Court of Justice (ICJ) recently ruled that Israel's settlement in the West Bank is illegal, but this advisory ruling is unlikely to change the situation on the ground. Both Israel and Hamas face limitations and challenges, and the region faces a volatile future with the potential for war to expand.  Efforts for a ceasefire remain stalled due to lack of determination, equity, and enforceability.  Millions are displaced, and countless lives are lost, with civilian casualties increasing the risk of further radicalization. The economic consequences are also significant, impacting countries beyond the immediate conflict zone.   Ultimately, there is no clear winner in this conflict, and the situation poses a major challenge for the international community.

The article criticizes employment reservation laws, using the example of Haryana's 2020 Act and Karnataka's recently proposed bill. It argues that such laws are unconstitutional, deter foreign investment, hinder labor market flexibility, and stifle innovation. 

The author points to the success of Silicon Valley, fueled by immigration, as a counterpoint to the argument for local employment reservation.  The article suggests that open labor markets, allowing for skilled workers from diverse backgrounds, are crucial for economic growth and innovation.  

It concludes by expressing relief that Karnataka has paused its bill, highlighting the damaging consequences of restricting talent based on residency.

Mumbai offers a diverse range of exploration opportunities, including two contrasting museums. The National Museum of Indian Cinema, located in upscale Cumbala Hill, chronicles the history of Indian filmmaking from its earliest days to modern times. Housed in a 19th-century building with a rich history, the museum showcases iconic films, actors, and the evolution of technology.

In stark contrast, the BEST Transport Museum, situated in a bus depot in Sion, delves into the history of urban transportation in Mumbai. Through models and memorabilia, visitors can trace the journey from horse-drawn trams to modern buses, understanding the vital role BEST has played in shaping the city's growth and economy.

Guru Purnima marks the first full moon of Dakshinayana, a significant day in yogic tradition.  It commemorates the birth of the Adi Guru, the first teacher from whom yogic sciences originated. Adiyogi, the first Yogi, shared profound teachings with the Saptarishis, his seven initial disciples, on how humans can transcend limitations. This day signifies the opening of new possibilities for human consciousness.

### [Budget 2024: Time to propel ‘Skill India’ as an employment engine](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/budget-2024-time-to-propel-skill-india-as-an-employment-engine-13795326.html)

The upcoming Union Budget is expected to focus on skill development and employment, recognizing the need for a skilled workforce in key sectors. The government aims to empower vulnerable populations through skill training, particularly school dropouts, to address the unemployment crisis and drive economic growth.  

However, concerns exist regarding the effectiveness of existing programs like Skill India, with issues like delayed implementation and a lack of placement support. Data reveals a rising number of educated unemployed individuals, highlighting the urgency for concrete measures to bridge the skill gap. Experts emphasize the need to align skill development with industry demands, improve job-focused education, and prioritize upskilling initiatives for gig workers.  A significant budget allocation for skills training, especially for disadvantaged youth, is crucial for  India's economic growth and social empowerment.

### [How long is the long arm of the American ‘Deep State’?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-long-is-the-long-arm-of-the-american-deep-state-13795297.html)

The attempted assassination of Donald Trump raises significant questions about security in the US.  It marks the first known attempt on someone aligned with the presidency since John F. Kennedy's assassination in 1963. The incident brings renewed focus to America's "gun culture" and the Second Amendment. Trump supporters allege involvement of a "Deep State," echoing claims about the Kennedy assassination. This incident, coinciding with President Biden's recent COVID-19 diagnosis, further complicates the upcoming election.  While the assassin's motive remains unclear,  concerns linger about the potential for further violence and the implications for American democracy.

Sun, 21 Jul 2024 11:02:56 +0530
### [Skyfall: The assassin’s bullet that Donald Trump dodged with minimal damage has hit Joe Biden instead](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/skyfall-the-assassins-bullet-that-donald-trump-dodged-with-minimal-damage-has-hit-joe-biden-instead-13795247.html)

Last week, the US political landscape was dramatically reshaped. Donald Trump, after narrowly escaping an assassination attempt, emerged with a renewed image of invincibility, further galvanizing the Republican Party at its convention in Milwaukee. In contrast, President Joe Biden faced a mounting internal rebellion within his own party, with increasing calls for him to step down due to concerns over his age and declining mental acuity, exacerbated by a series of recent gaffes.

Democratic megadonors are threatening to withhold funding, and even influential figures like former President Barack Obama have expressed concerns about Biden's ability to win the upcoming election. 

Despite the pressure, Biden remains defiant, refusing to concede.  Meanwhile, Trump, capitalizing on his perceived resilience, is experiencing a surge in both grassroots support and financial contributions, with notable figures like Elon Musk pledging significant donations to his campaign. These powerful opposing narratives, one of resilience and comeback, the other of decline and internal conflict, effectively capture the unsettling dynamic unfolding in American politics.

### [Why India can neither shun Russia nor ignore West](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-india-can-neither-shun-russia-nor-ignore-west-13795128.html)

The article discusses India's relations with Russia and the West, particularly in the context of the ongoing Ukraine war. Western criticism of India's continued engagement with Russia has been met with confusion and frustration in India.  The article argues that India's approach to balancing its relationship with both sides is driven by strategic interests, recognizing Russia's regional importance and the West's significant economic and political influence. While acknowledging the limitations of its relationship with Russia, particularly in terms of economic depth and future prospects, India is determined to maintain its autonomy and protect its interests.  The author cautions against both underestimating Russia's potential for disruption and overestimating India's power on the world stage, emphasizing the need for pragmatic diplomacy and focusing on India's internal development.

### [Terror attacks in Jammu: Time to understand Pakistan’s deep-seated anti-India mindset](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/terror-attacks-in-jammu-role-of-pakistan-in-militancy-in-jammu-and-kashmir-13795121.html)

This article analyzes the recent surge in terrorist attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, arguing that India's strategy towards Pakistan is fundamentally flawed.  

The author contends that India has traditionally underestimated Pakistan's motivations and capabilities, viewing the conflict as primarily geopolitical rather than religious. This has led to diplomatic miscalculations and a failure to grasp the depth of Pakistan's commitment to the "jihad" against India. 

He highlights Pakistan's extensive network of terror groups, their support system within Kashmir, and their ability to adapt tactics over time.  The author argues that the recent upsurge is not isolated but part of a long-term strategy by Pakistan to destabilize India.  He emphasizes the importance of a long-range vision, strategic understanding, and a lasting solution to the Pakistan problem to effectively counter this persistent threat.

### [Budget 2024: Optimising resources for better educational outcomes](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/budget-2024-optimising-resources-for-better-educational-outcomes-13795085.html)

India faces a learning crisis where, despite increased education spending, many children lack fundamental reading and math skills.  

The NIPUN Bharat Mission aims to improve foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN) by 2026. However, inefficient funding disbursement and a limited focus on impactful areas hinder its success. 

To maximize the mission's impact, the government should shift to three-year rolling disbursements, allowing states more time for effective planning and resource utilization.  Further, states should prioritize investments in early childhood education, teacher training, school-based assessments, and awareness campaigns.  
 
 Enhancing early childhood education, training teachers, utilizing data-driven assessments, and fostering public awareness are key to ensuring every child achieves FLN proficiency and contributes to national development.

### [Nepal has a new prime minister and it may be good news for China](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/nepal-has-a-new-prime-minister-and-it-may-be-good-news-for-china-13795067.html)

KP Sharma Oli has been sworn in as the Prime Minister of Nepal for his fourth term, leading a coalition government with the Nepali Congress. Known for his anti-India and pro-China stance, Oli aims to strengthen ties with Beijing. He has a history of escalating tensions with India, particularly over border issues and Tibet.  

China views Nepal as strategically important due to its proximity to Tibet, where it seeks to suppress Tibetan independence movements. Oli's government is expected to push for closer alignment with China's Belt and Road Initiative and its Global Security Initiative, potentially causing friction with the US and India. The US, meanwhile, seeks to counter China's influence in the region through support for Tibetan rights and initiatives like the Millennium Challenge Corporation, which China sees as a challenge to its regional strategy.

### [Beyond third plenum: China’s slowing economy demands a more consensus-based approach from Beijing](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/beyond-third-plenum-chinas-slowing-economy-demands-a-more-consensus-based-approach-from-beijing-13795041.html)

China's economic slowdown is a major concern, marking a shift from its previous double-digit growth.  The country's GDP growth is projected to decline to 4.5 percent this fiscal year and further to 3 percent by 2029. The real estate sector, once a major driver of the Chinese economy, is in distress.  Government stimulus measures haven't been successful in reviving demand. 

Global factors, including a high trade deficit and international backlash against China's geopolitical actions, are also contributing to the slowdown. China's reliance on low-cost labor is diminishing, and its aging population poses a significant challenge. 

President Xi Jinping's strategy for reform focuses on high-quality development through advanced manufacturing and technology. However, China faces challenges in competing in the global market for high-tech products. Its aggressive foreign policy has also strained relationships with key trading partners like India.

### [How China’s growing clout in South Caucasus can be challenging for India](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-chinas-growing-clout-in-south-caucasus-can-be-challenging-for-india-13794912.html)

Recent developments in the South Caucasus, particularly China's growing involvement, have significant geopolitical implications. China's direct flight from Urumqi to Yerevan highlights its increasing presence in the region, seen as a counter to US influence. 

China's strong ties with Russia, Turkey, Azerbaijan, and Iran, coupled with substantial economic investments, position it as a major player. India's interests in the region hinge on realizing the potential of the International North-South Transport Corridor (INSTC) and mitigating the influence of Turkey, Pakistan, and China. 

China's support for a rival corridor route through Zangezur, backed by Turkey, threatens India's connectivity goals. Amidst this complex landscape, Russia could emerge as a potential ally for India, given its strong regional standing and influence.

### [A risky bet: Should India go ahead with the Teesta project with Bangladesh?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/a-risky-bet-should-india-go-ahead-with-the-teesta-project-with-bangladesh-13794820.html)

Sheikh Hasina's recent diplomatic push for funding in China was met with a limited response, prompting her to look towards India for financial support for the Teesta River redevelopment project.  Should India agree to this project, it would not only address long-standing water-sharing disputes but also foster greater economic and infrastructural integration between the two nations. However, India must carefully balance the economic and diplomatic benefits with potential domestic political repercussions and the risks associated with Bangladesh's economic vulnerabilities and ongoing socio-political challenges, including a rising radical Islamic population. Despite these complexities, strategic engagement with Bangladesh through the Teesta project presents a valuable opportunity for India to consolidate its regional influence.

### [From ‘non-Artic’ to ‘near-Arctic’: Growing China Factor in the India-Russia Far East cooperation](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/from-non-artic-to-near-arctic-growing-china-factor-in-the-india-russia-far-east-cooperation-13794736.html)

The 22nd Annual Bilateral Summit between Russia and India emphasized cooperation in trade, economic, and investment spheres, especially in the Russian Far East and Arctic regions.  

This summit comes amidst heightened activity and geopolitical rivalry in the Arctic, driven by climate change and resource competition.  

While Russia is seeking closer ties with China, India is striving to balance its relationship with both nations. 

China's increasing presence in the Arctic through investments, research stations, and diplomatic outreach has raised concerns among Western nations, including the US, which views it as a potential challenge to its interests. India, with its Arctic policy and existing diplomatic relations with Arctic Council members, can play a stabilizing role in the region.  

India recognizes the opportunity the Arctic presents for securing access to critical minerals and aims to engage actively in Arctic affairs through a "Whole of Government Approach"  to  maximize its potential benefits.

### [Amid hope for change, can Iran’s new President revive nuclear deal with West?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/amid-hope-for-change-can-irans-new-president-revive-nuclear-deal-with-west-13794716.html)

Iran held presidential elections in July 2024, resulting in the victory of Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist and former health minister. Pezeshkian's election signals a shift from hardline conservatives and brings optimism about reviving the Iran nuclear deal.  

Javed Zarif, Pezeshkian's likely foreign minister and a key player in the 2015 nuclear deal, is expected to lead these efforts. Despite Iran upholding its nuclear commitments after the U.S. withdrawal in 2018, it has since increased uranium enrichment, raising concerns. Complicating the situation is the ongoing war in Gaza, strained U.S.-Iran relations, and potential geopolitical shifts in the region.

Although the previous rounds of talks made progress, the revival faces challenges, including U.S. sanctions on Iran's Revolutionary Guard Corps and disputes over Iran's ballistic missile program. Despite these hurdles, President Pezeshkian and Zarif seek to alleviate economic sanctions and restore stability through diplomatic channels.  The success of these efforts remains uncertain due to various political and regional factors.

### [Head-on | Trump assassination bid could embolden anti-India forces](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/head-on-trump-assassination-bid-could-embolden-anti-india-forces-13794632.html)

The article discusses the rise of toxic politics in both the US and India, exemplified by verbal attacks against political figures like Donald Trump and Narendra Modi. 

It highlights concerns about the escalating rhetoric and its potential to incite violence, citing recent incidents in the US and UK. The author argues that this negativity can be harmful to both the attackers and the attacked, suggesting that focusing on issues and policy alternatives is a more productive approach. 


The article draws parallels between Trump's political strategy in the US and Modi's in India, both positioning themselves against established elites. It concludes by urging opposition parties in India to adopt a similar approach of focusing on issues rather than resorting to personal attacks.

### [Dhaka University’s ‘revolutionary’ road: Agitation, violence not new on campus](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/dhaka-universitys-revolutionary-road-agitation-violence-not-new-on-campus-13794524.html)

Following intense clashes on university campuses across Dhaka, the University Grants Commission has issued a closure order for all universities pending further instructions.  The protests erupted over job allocations, reignited when the High Court reinstated a quota system for children of freedom fighters, a system that was previously abolished in 2018. The Supreme Court has now suspended the High Court's order for four weeks. 

Dhaka University, at the heart of the violence, boasts a history intertwined with student activism and rebellion. Notable incidents include  the Language Movement of 1952, where the university played a pivotal role in securing Bangla as a state language, and the tragic events during the 1971 war of liberation where the Pakistani Army attacked the campus, resulting in the deaths of hundreds of students and faculty. 


Concerns are growing that the current unrest, stemming from the quota system, may be influenced by political agendas, taking advantage of student frustration with the government.

Germany's left-leaning government, despite criticizing India for its alleged human rights violations, is cracking down on dissent within its own borders. The government shut down a right-wing magazine, Compact, labelling it anti-Semitic and raided its offices, freezing the bank accounts of its contributors. This action has sparked controversy, as it appears to contradict Germany's constitutionally protected freedom of speech. The government claims that Compact is a "nexus" for far-right extremist groups and poses a threat to the constitution. However, critics argue that the move is an attempt to silence opposition ahead of upcoming elections and suppress growing discontent with the government's handling of issues like immigration and the economy.

### [Rising terror attacks in Jammu signal new threats](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/rising-terror-attacks-in-jammu-signal-new-threats-13793822.html)

Terrorist attacks in Jammu have risen sharply following the abrogation of Article 370, marking a shift in strategy from Pakistan-based groups.  Security agencies believe that multiple terrorist groups have infiltrated Jammu, potentially aiming to destabilize the region and disrupt upcoming assembly elections. This surge in violence is viewed as an attempt to revive terrorism in Jammu after a relative lull and to keep the Kashmir issue prevalent on the international stage. India is responding with increased security measures, including area dominance strategies, tightened border controls and operations against terrorist groups.  The government is also focusing on dismantling terrorist financing networks and curtailing support from local sources.

### [Assassination bid makes Trump 2.0 all but certain](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/assassination-bid-makes-trump-2-0-all-but-certain-13794328.html)

An assassination attempt on Donald Trump during a Pennsylvania rally narrowly missed, killing one attendee and wounding two others. The incident occurred when an assailant, a registered Republican, fired at Trump from a nearby rooftop. While the Secret Service swiftly brought the situation under control, concerns were raised about a potential security lapse.  

The attack has sparked increased political tensions and is likely to impact the upcoming presidential race. Trump is expected to gain sympathy and support, potentially widening his lead over President Biden, who faces growing criticism over his age and handling of the presidency. Some Democrats, while loyal to Biden, suggest a need for a younger candidate to challenge Trump.

### [Is China all set to overtake US in advanced technologies?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/is-china-all-set-to-overtake-us-in-advanced-technologies-13794141.html)

The article discusses the rapidly advancing technological power of China and its growing competition with the United States. It highlights various data points, including patent applications, research outputs, and manufacturing capabilities, to illustrate China's progress in key emerging technologies.

The report points to China's focus on government-backed research initiatives, a larger pool of STEM graduates, and a cost advantage that fuels its technological advancements. 

China is making significant strides in areas like high-speed rail, solar energy, electric vehicles, 6G communications, and even space and military technologies. While acknowledging the strength of American companies like Apple, Google, and Tesla, the article suggests that China is closing the gap and is on track to become a dominant force in global technology. 

The author emphasizes the Chinese government's long-term planning and its willingness to invest heavily in areas crucial for national development. China's rise as a technological power is seen as a major shift in global dynamics, challenging the US's long-held dominance and potentially leading to a multipolar world.

### [Why no second chances for Vance?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-no-second-chances-for-vance-13794036.html)

JD Vance's nomination as Republican Vice Presidential candidate has sparked intense scrutiny and criticism from liberal commentators. Despite his disadvantaged background as a poor white man from the Rust Belt, Vance's rise to prominence, documented in his bestselling book "Hillbilly Elegy," resonates with a segment of American society often overlooked by mainstream media. 

Trump's selection of Vance, a young and unconventional candidate, signifies a generational shift within the Republican Party, aiming to appeal to younger voters, especially Gen Z and Millennials. Vance's outspoken stance on issues like Ukraine and his willingness to make provocative statements appeal to this demographic.  

Critics, however, point to Vance's past criticism of Trump and question his experience and qualifications. His selection highlights the internal divisions within the Republican Party and the ongoing battle between Trump's loyalists and his detractors. Vance's wife, Usha, who identifies as a Democrat and works in a "woke" law firm, adds another layer of complexity to his narrative, suggesting a nuanced perspective on politics and a potential bridge between different ideological camps.

The recent attempted assassination of Donald Trump by 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks resembles historical patterns of young individuals altering history through violence. The article draws parallels to Gavrilo Princip, who assassinated Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914, sparking World War I, and Fernand Bonnier de la Chapelle, who killed French collaborationist leader Francois Darlan in 1942.  The author speculates on the motivations behind such acts, suggesting that those deemed inconvenient by powerful figures may become targets for young, determined individuals. The article highlights  the lasting impact of these historical events and the recurring theme of young assassins influencing the course of history.

A recent study highlighted the high sugar content in baby food products in developing countries compared to Europe. This raises concerns about children developing a taste for high sugar from a young age, leading to long-term health issues like obesity and type 2 diabetes. 

The study also points to the growing trend of ultra-processed food consumption in developing countries, driven by aggressive marketing by multinational corporations. These foods are often high in sugar, salt, and additives, contributing to the obesity epidemic and other health problems.  

The author calls on governments to strengthen regulatory frameworks for food products and encourage healthier dietary practices.

The assassination attempt on former President Donald Trump highlights the dangers of political revenge and the erosion of democratic norms.  The incident, occurring during a critical point in the election cycle where Trump's campaign was gaining momentum, raises concerns about the increasing acceptance of extreme measures in political discourse. 

This act of violence reflects a broader trend of escalating political extremism, fueled by deep divisions and intolerance. The incident underscores the fragility of democracy and the urgent need to protect democratic values, uphold the rule of law, and ensure the integrity of the electoral process. The author emphasizes the importance of civil discourse, respect for opposing viewpoints, and the media's responsibility to provide balanced and objective reporting to prevent further escalation of political violence.

On July 13th, a shooting occurred at one of Donald Trump's rallies in Pennsylvania. The former president was targeted by an assailant, who was subsequently shot and killed by law enforcement.  Though Trump sustained a minor injury, he continued his campaign and is now widely expected to secure the Republican nomination.

This incident has been likened to the 1981 assassination attempt on Ronald Reagan, who went on to win re-election. 

The shooting has galvanized the Republican base, with many viewing Trump's resilience as a sign of strength and divine protection. It has also prompted questions about security at political events and the increasing polarization of American politics.

Macron, despite aiming for the same kind of heroic image, falls short, failing to achieve the gravitas and lasting impact that De Gaulle possessed.

The author emphasizes the increasing prevalence of mental health challenges and encourages open conversations about the issue.

### [China’s Panchsheel embrace: A smokescreen for aggression](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/chinas-panchsheel-embrace-a-smokescreen-for-aggression-13793123.html)

China recently hosted a conference to mark the platinum jubilee of the Panchsheel (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence). Despite espousing these principles, China's actions, especially towards India, contradict its professed commitment.

China's occupation of Indian territories, its support for Pakistan's stance on Kashmir, and its aggressive posture towards India violate tenets of mutual respect, non-aggression, and peaceful coexistence. China's support for terrorism and its double standards on the issue further expose its hypocrisy. The author argues that China's current emphasis on the Panchsheel is merely a facade to deflect attention from its own wrongdoings and urges India to be wary of this tactic.

### [Yes, Nehru played a role in Austria’s emergence as independent nation, but that’s just half the story](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/yes-nehru-played-a-role-in-austrias-emergence-as-independent-nation-but-thats-just-half-the-story-13792963.html)

After World War I, Austria became a landlocked country.  In the 1930s, with the rise of fascism, Austria saw a civil war and the formation of a fascist government.  Nazi Germany annexed Austria in 1938, and the country became a key collaborator in the Nazi regime's crimes, including the construction of concentration camps like Mauthausen. 

Following the war, Austria promoted the "first victim" theory, claiming to have been merely occupied by the Nazis, thereby minimizing its role in the atrocities. This narrative was used to avoid reparations and accountability for Austria's actions.  Though now discredited, this theory persisted for decades,  leaving a complex and challenging legacy for Austria.
