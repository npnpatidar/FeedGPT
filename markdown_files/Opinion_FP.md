The article discusses the recent Israel-Palestine conflict and highlights the disturbing trend of some leftists and Islamists expressing admiration for Adolf Hitler and justifying the Holocaust. The author argues that these groups are ideologically closer to the Nazis than they would admit, and that their ideologies breed hate, intolerance, and violence. The article also criticizes the global Left for failing to condemn this glorification of genocide. Additionally, the author mentions instances where leftists, such as Hollywood actor Whoopi Goldberg, have made controversial statements related to the Holocaust. The article concludes by stating that the underlying notions of racial supremacy in Nazism are manifested in communism and religious superiority in Islamism.

### [Vantage | How is a 'broke' Pakistan handing out 45% salary hikes?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/vantage-how-is-a-broke-pakistan-handing-out-45-salary-hikes-13343622.html)

Pakistan's decision to grant a 45% salary increase to top bureaucrats in management positions has sparked controversy and raised concerns about the country's priorities. This move comes at a time when Pakistan is facing economic challenges, including declining per capita income, rising inflation, and a growing population living in poverty. The government argues that the salary increase is necessary to attract top talent from the private sector, but critics question the timing and economic context of this decision. Pakistan's per capita income has fallen, inflation is high, and a significant portion of the population lives in poverty. The role of the caretaker Prime Minister, who has gone beyond the mandate of maintaining the status quo, is also being questioned. The International Monetary Fund is closely monitoring Pakistan's financial situation and has agreed to provide a bailout, but the actions of the caretaker government could jeopardize this. The implications of this decision on Pakistan's economy and political landscape will become clearer in the coming months.

### [Vantage | Why winter and West will decide which way Ukraine war heads](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/vantage-why-winter-and-west-will-decide-which-way-ukraine-war-heads-13342692.html)

The conflict in Ukraine continues to escalate, with Russia intensifying its attacks and shelling over 100 settlements in a single day. Ukraine's concerns are heightened as winter approaches, making combat even more challenging. Despite a counter-offensive launched by Ukraine, it has not made significant progress in breaking through Russian lines. President Zelensky emphasizes the extraordinary achievements of Ukraine in this war but acknowledges the need for new technology to break the stalemate. President Biden proposed a significant aid package to bolster Ukraine's capabilities, but it faces resistance from Republicans. War fatigue is spreading across Europe, and Ukraine's foreign minister is seeking support from European nations. One potential game-changer could be the arrival of F-16 fighter jets to bolster Ukraine's air capabilities. However, Russia dismisses this as futile. A prolonged stalemate places Ukraine in a precarious position as it desperately needs a breakthrough to change the course of the conflict.

His advocacy for women's empowerment goes beyond politics; it is rooted in his belief in the capabilities and contributions of women. Chouhan's emotional bonds with the women of Madhya Pradesh make him a symbol of trust and hope, offering not just policies but also emotional support. His leadership serves as a reminder that true leadership involves forming deep connections with the people one serves.

### [Vantage | Why Myanmar's rebel alliance has left China so worried](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/vantage-why-myanmars-rebel-alliance-has-left-china-so-worried-13342862.html)

Rebel groups in Myanmar, known as the Brotherhood Alliance, have launched a successful attack on the ruling military junta. The rebels have captured territory in the Shan state, including the strategic trading hub of Chinshwehaw, which lies on a major China-Myanmar trade route. This has raised concerns for China, as a significant portion of trade between the two countries passes through this route. Additionally, China's future plans, including the China-Myanmar Economic Corridor and a billion-dollar railway line, are at risk due to the rebel offensive. China has been a mediator in the past and has invested billions in the region, so it is unlikely to let the rebel alliance defeat Myanmar's junta. China's public security minister recently met with Myanmar's junta chief to address the situation and protect its interests.

Bhutan, a neighboring country to India, is shifting its diplomatic relations and moving closer to establishing formal ties with China. This change in approach has raised concerns about the impact on Indian interests in the region. Bhutan's King's visit to India is expected to shed light on these evolving dynamics. Bhutan has traditionally maintained a close partnership with India while refraining from forming formal ties with China. However, recent developments, including a visit by Bhutan's foreign minister to China and boundary talks, indicate a significant shift in Bhutan's approach. The disputed border, including territories like Doklam, is a prominent obstacle in Bhutan's pursuit of formal relations with China. This area holds strategic significance for India as it connects India to its northeastern states. India's primary concern is the potential erosion of its influence in Bhutan and the ongoing border talks. India must articulate its interests clearly to Bhutan and closely monitor China's activities in the region. The visit of Bhutan's King to India provides an opportunity for both sides to exchange perspectives and address concerns about Bhutan's evolving relationship with China.

### [Let’s not communalise the hijab issue and wait for Supreme Court verdict](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/lets-not-communalise-the-hijab-issue-and-wait-for-supreme-court-verdict-13341782.html)

The Karnataka government recently allowed Muslim women candidates to wear the hijab for the National Eligibility cum Entrance Exam (NEET), which has sparked controversy and protests from Hindu groups. The hijab controversy dates back to January 2022 when six girls wearing the hijab were prevented from entering a college in Udupi. The matter was taken to the Karnataka High Court, which upheld the ban, but an appeal was filed in the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court gave a split verdict, with one judge upholding the ban and another stating that wearing the hijab is a choice. The recent decision by the Karnataka government to allow hijab for NEET must be seen in this context. The BJP, now in opposition, opposes the decision, while the Higher Education Minister argues that it is allowed under NEET's dress guidelines. The controversy surrounding the hijab is a larger issue of confrontation between radical pro-Hindu and Muslim organizations. Those who oppose it see it as a sign of subordination, while those who support it argue for freedom of choice. The author believes that while Muslim women have the right to choose what they wear, their freedom should not perpetuate sartorial enslavement imposed by men. It is best not to communalize this matter for political reasons and await the Supreme Court's verdict.

India is facing a severe air pollution crisis, with the arrival of winter exacerbating the problem. Delhi, the nation's capital, is the third most polluted city in the world, and residents are effectively smoking the equivalent of 15 cigarettes a day just by breathing the air. The air quality crisis is not limited to Delhi, as 22 out of the 30 most polluted cities in the world are located in India. This crisis is not unique to India, as other countries like Chad, Iraq, Pakistan, Bahrain, and Bangladesh also face high levels of air pollution. Even wealthier nations like the US, China, and parts of Europe are experiencing worsening air quality. Air pollution is responsible for numerous health issues and millions of deaths each year. The Indian government has taken some measures to address the crisis, but more needs to be done. The author emphasizes the need for collective effort and a demand for change to mitigate this man-made disaster.

The article discusses the role of TikTok in spreading propaganda and disinformation, particularly with a pro-Palestine bias. It highlights the significant difference in views between pro-Israel and pro-Palestine hashtags on TikTok, indicating a potential problem with the content being circulated. The article also mentions that TikTok has been used as a platform for pro-Hamas propaganda, which can have real-world consequences such as fueling anti-Semitism. Despite TikTok's claims of removing problematic content, many believe that their efforts are insufficient. The article suggests that rebuilding trust in traditional media and addressing the algorithmic reinforcement of biases are necessary steps to combat this issue. It also mentions that India banned TikTok in 2020 due to national security concerns, and the United States has faced challenges in attempting to ban the app as well. The article concludes by emphasizing the global concern of TikTok's spread of propaganda and the need for action to create a safer information environment.

Hmm, I am not sure. Email support@chatbase.co for more info.Latin American countries, including Bolivia, Chile, and Colombia, have taken a clear stance against Israel in the Israel-Hamas war. Bolivia has cut all diplomatic ties with Israel, citing the aggressive and disproportionate Israeli military offensive in Gaza. Chile accuses Israel of breaking international laws, while Colombia's president compared Israel to Neo-Nazis. The sentiment in Latin America is that Israel should stop the attacks and declare a ceasefire. The Global South, including Latin America, wants a ceasefire and is mostly against Israel due to historical reasons, their own priorities such as fighting inflation and poverty, and a rejection of the existing world order. The Global South sees Israel as an extension of Western hypocrisy and is pushing against it.

Sri Lanka has become the center of an international dispute involving a Chinese vessel named Shi Yan Six. China claims that the vessel is a research ship, but both India and the US suspect it has ulterior motives. The ship recently docked in Colombo, leading to speculation about its purpose. While China initially stated that the ship was there to restock and replenish supplies, its plans seemed to change once it arrived. Sri Lankan officials became involved in the ship's research exercise, turning it into a joint effort. India has expressed concerns about Chinese research vessels in the region, as they possess capabilities that could threaten national security. The Indian Navy is closely monitoring the situation and urging regional cooperation to ensure the safety and security of the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka finds itself in a delicate position between global superpowers and should be prepared for stronger pushback in the face of future visits by Chinese research vessels.

The ongoing conflict in Gaza has caused concerns among Arab Americans and could impact President Joe Biden's chances of re-election in 2024. The Arab American community, which historically supported Biden and the Democratic Party, is dissatisfied with his approach to the Israel-Gaza conflict. This shift in support could lead to a contentious rematch between Biden and former President Donald Trump. While the US has a long-standing relationship with Israel, Arab Americans are calling for an immediate ceasefire and have issued an ultimatum to Biden. Arab American voters played a crucial role in flipping key swing states in the 2020 election, and Biden's re-election prospects rely heavily on maintaining their support. However, the community's unhappiness extends beyond Biden to the Democratic Party as a whole. An increasing number of Arab Americans now identify as Independents, raising questions about their voting preferences in 2024. The outcome of the Israel-Gaza conflict and US support for Israel will shape the 2024 election and Biden's political future.

The US Department of Defense has announced plans to build a new nuclear bomb called the B61-13. This bomb is estimated to be 24 times more powerful than the one dropped on Hiroshima and 14 times more potent than the one used on Nagasaki during World War II. The B61-13 will incorporate modernized safety, security, and accuracy features. The Pentagon's plan involves replacing some of its largest and most powerful bombs with the B61-13, which is seen as a cost-effective strategy. However, critics argue that the increased destructive power could lead to unintended collateral damage and escalate international tensions. The decision to pursue the B61-13 is driven by a changing security environment and growing threats from potential adversaries, believed to be Russia and China. All three nations have been expanding their nuclear capabilities, raising concerns about global security and stability. The estimated cost of building the B61-13 is approximately $10 billion.

### [Vantage | How Venezuela fits into India's smart oil market strategy](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/vantage-how-venezuela-fits-into-indias-smart-oil-market-strategy-13329032.html)

India is actively seeking multiple sources to import crude oil due to tensions in West Asia. The ongoing conflict in the region, particularly the recent ground offensive by Israel, has raised concerns about potential disruptions in oil supply. As West Asia is home to some of the world's largest oil-producing countries, any escalation of the conflict could have significant repercussions on global oil prices. India heavily relies on West Asia for its oil imports, so the conflict poses a threat to its energy security. To mitigate this risk, India is exploring alternatives, such as Venezuela, which has vast oil reserves. However, previous sanctions imposed by the United States disrupted India's oil trade with Venezuela. The recent lifting of these sanctions provides India with an opportunity to resume its oil trade with Venezuela at discounted prices, diversifying its oil sources and reducing costs. India has also been increasing its oil imports from Russia, which has become its largest oil supplier, in response to the conflict in Ukraine and the need to diversify sources away from West Asia. Despite higher oil prices, India's import bill has decreased, thanks to its partnership with Russia. These strategic moves demonstrate India's prudent approach to navigating the complex global oil market and securing its oil supplies.

The absence of Israel on these maps has sparked speculation about whether it was a deliberate political statement or a software glitch. China's foreign ministry has responded vaguely, leaving questions about their motives. Despite officially declaring itself a neutral party in the conflict, there has been a surge in anti-Semitism within China, fueled by influential voices on social media. This raises questions about the future of the relationship between China and Israel.

French President Emmanuel Macron has pledged to enshrine abortion rights in the French constitution by the end of next year. This commitment comes in response to the global trend of restricting women's autonomy over their own bodies. France's current abortion laws protect women's anonymity, guarantee their health, and cover the cost of abortions through the social security system. Macron's initiative aims to make these rights irreversible by amending the constitution, a complex process that requires a referendum or approval by three-fifths of the parliament. This move is significant in the global landscape of abortion rights, where some countries are legalizing abortion while others are rolling back access. Macron's pledge offers hope for women fighting for reproductive autonomy and ensures the permanence of these rights regardless of the government in power.

The incoming President of Maldives, Mohamed Muizzu, has expressed his desire to remove the Indian military presence in the country. He plans to hold diplomatic consultations with India to work out the details of sending back military personnel. Currently, there are approximately 75 Indian military personnel stationed in the Maldives to support the Maldivian military. India has also provided military hardware and financial support for the maintenance of these assets. However, Muizzu's focus on removing India's military presence has raised diplomatic concerns, especially considering the economic challenges and debt obligations that Maldives is facing. The country's economy is expected to service a record $1.07 billion in external debt by 2026, and its foreign reserves are limited. Despite these economic challenges, Muizzu remains determined to prioritize the removal of India's military presence. This decision is seen by many as politically motivated rather than strategically necessary. Muizzu also plans to improve ties with China and believes that China's Belt and Road Initiative can play a crucial role in Maldives' development.

Infosys co-founder Narayana Murthy's comments suggesting that Indian youth should work 70 hours a week have sparked a debate. However, research has shown that longer hours do not necessarily lead to more productivity, success, or money. Working long hours can even be harmful, as it is estimated to cause 750,000 deaths each year. While some people choose to work long hours and succeed, the key to sustaining such a schedule is finding enjoyment in one's work. Balancing work and leisure can lead to greater productivity.

Chinese President Xi Jinping recently broke his silence and addressed China's economic challenges by visiting the central bank. The country is facing issues such as high unemployment, a job crisis, and debt-ridden local governments. During his visit, Xi Jinping made it clear that he will not tolerate an economic slowdown and announced changes to the government budget, involving the issuance of new bonds. This budget adjustment is rare for China, with the last one occurring in 2008 after the Sichuan earthquake. However, critics argue that China's debt-driven approach may not be sustainable, and sound policy interventions are needed. In a surprise move, Xi Jinping removed his finance minister and appointed a technocrat to handle the local government debt crisis. As China navigates its path in a complex global economy, the effectiveness of these measures and their ability to sustain economic stability will be closely watched.

Hong Kong is facing a low birth rate crisis, and the government is offering cash handouts of $2,500 to new parents. However, research suggests that money alone will not solve the problem, as there are various factors contributing to the low birth rate, such as the high cost of living, lack of family-friendly policies, workplace discrimination against mothers, and a culture of overwork. To address this issue, a holistic approach is needed, including pro-family policies, changes in social attitudes, and financial support. Simply throwing money at the problem will not be effective.

Indian regulators have cracked down on financial influencers who engage in misleading practices, such as promising high profits and disguising stock recommendations as educational courses. One influencer, Mohammed Ansari, was banned from accessing India's securities market and fined Rs 17 crore ($2 million) for his deceptive practices. Other influencers, including PR Sundar, have also faced bans and fines. The legality of these influencers' activities lies in the fact that only registered entities like stockbroking firms and mutual funds can provide formal investment advice. These influencers may have vested interests in the advice they offer, potentially receiving commissions or undisclosed incentives. Indian regulators are proposing that financial influencers register themselves to eliminate the possibility of personal gains. However, some influencers argue that they are merely educators providing valuable information and should not be grouped with those engaged in deceptive practices. Ultimately, individuals must exercise caution and skepticism when considering financial advice from influencers and rely on traditional sources of expertise for credible advice.

Eight Indian navy veterans who worked for a defense company in Qatar, owned by a retired squadron leader of Oman's air force, are facing the death penalty. The circumstances surrounding their arrests, charges, and trial have raised questions due to the lack of transparency. The company's website, which once claimed deals with Qatar's navy, has now removed such information. The veterans were arrested by Qatar's state security bureau in August 2022 without informing the Indian embassy. The trial, which started in March, has raised questions about the charges against the men, as the information has not been made public. Speculation suggests that the veterans were involved in espionage, but this remains unconfirmed. India and Qatar have historically had strong relations, making this case a diplomatic challenge for India. India has invited the Emir of Qatar to visit, but there has been no response yet. The hope is for a resolution at a diplomatic level.

The port's strategic significance lies in its proximity to the Malacca Strait, a vital chokepoint for China's energy imports. By gaining access to the port, India has the opportunity to exploit China's vulnerability in the strait and potentially exert leverage over its energy supplies. The cooperation between India and Indonesia on the port project is part of India's broader efforts to increase its influence in Southeast Asia. However, Indonesia faces a delicate balancing act as it seeks to deepen cooperation with India while managing its complex relationship with China. The partnership between India and Indonesia highlights shifting power dynamics in the Indo-Pacific region and contributes to the broader narrative of strategic realignments in Southeast Asia.

### [Vantage | What to make of this unusually 'warm' week in US-China ties](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/vantage-what-to-make-of-this-unusually-warm-week-in-us-china-relationship-13300762.html)

Chinese President Xi Jinping has sent a letter expressing willingness to cooperate with the US and build stable Sino-US ties based on mutual respect and win-win cooperation. The letter has sparked hopes of a potential meeting between Xi and US President Joe Biden. However, the letter was not addressed to Biden directly but sent to an American non-profit organization dedicated to sino-US relations. Despite this, the letter signals a thaw in the frosty ties between the two countries. Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi is set to visit the US and meet with top officials to discuss China-US relations and international issues. Both Washington and Beijing hope that Wang Yi's visit will pave the way for a meeting between Xi and Biden next month. However, there are still concerns that the ongoing tensions and posturing between the two sides may hinder the meeting. The US has imposed new chip export controls on China and released a report on China's military activity, which Beijing strongly criticized. The situation remains uncertain, and it is unclear if anything meaningful will come out of a potential Xi-Biden meeting.

### [Vantage | Why China wants Foxconn founder to drop out of Taiwan presidential race](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/vantage-why-china-wants-foxconn-founder-to-drop-out-of-taiwan-presidential-race-13300732.html)

China has launched a tax investigation into Foxconn, a Taiwanese tech giant known for manufacturing iPhones. The investigation focuses on the land use at multiple Foxconn plants in China, raising concerns about the company's presence and economic contributions. This investigation is seen as politically motivated due to the ongoing conflict between China and Taiwan. Taiwan is a self-governed island that China considers a wayward province, and tensions between the two countries have been heightened ahead of Taiwan's upcoming presidential elections. The leading candidate in the elections is Vice President Lai Ching-te, a member of the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which advocates for Taiwan's formal independence from mainland China. China aims to weaken the DPP's chances in the elections by supporting the opposition party, Kuomintang, which is seen as more conciliatory towards Beijing. Terry Gou, the founder of Foxconn, is running as an independent candidate in the elections, potentially splitting the opposition vote and boosting the DPP's chances of victory. In response, China has pressured Foxconn to convince Gou to withdraw from the race. The investigation into Foxconn has had financial repercussions, with the company's shares losing over 5% of their value in just two days. The opposition Kuomintang party has remained cautious and quiet, recognizing the potential backlash associated with aligning too closely with Beijing. Overall, this investigation is seen as a political move by China to influence Taiwan's presidential elections and shape its political landscape using economic leverage.

### [Vantage | Why Hamas' underground tunnels are Israel's biggest challenge](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/vantage-why-hamas-underground-tunnels-are-israels-biggest-challenge-13299752.html)

The article discusses the extensive network of tunnels in Gaza that Hamas has used for various purposes, including smuggling, communication, storing weapons, and launching attacks. The tunnels are a major asset for Hamas and pose a significant threat to Israel during wars. The IDF has attempted to target these tunnels in the past but faces challenges due to their extensive nature and the presence of civilians above them. The article also mentions the historical success of tunnel warfare, such as the Viet Cong's use of tunnels in Vietnam. The Israeli leadership is concerned about Hamas potentially pulling off a similar strategy.

The article discusses the unanswered question of how Hamas was able to carry out the October 7 attack on Israel without being detected. It mentions that Egypt had given repeated warnings to Israel about a potential attack, even informing Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu personally. However, Netanyahu denies receiving such a call from Egypt. The article suggests that Netanyahu may have been distracted by other issues, such as a controversial judicial reform, which weakened Israel's defenses. Israeli intelligence also failed to anticipate the attack, with two major lapses identified: failure to monitor key communication channels used by Palestinian attackers and over-reliance on easily shut down border surveillance equipment. The Israeli military also had two gaps in their response to the attack: top leaders were clustered at a base near Gaza, slowing their response, and they underestimated Hamas despite picking up statements indicating they were not preparing for battle. A government commission of inquiry will investigate these failures, but there are concerns that Netanyahu may try to manipulate the commission. The article concludes by emphasizing the importance of not compromising national security for domestic politics.

### [Vantage | If only Pakistanis could ride on missiles instead of planes](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/vantage-if-only-pakistanis-could-ride-on-missiles-instead-of-planes-13298102.html)

Pakistan's government is facing criticism for its contrasting priorities amid economic instability. While Pakistan International Airlines (PIA) is grounded due to a lack of funds, the Pakistan Army continues to conduct missile tests, including the Ghauri missile. The Ghauri missile, developed in 1998, is relatively old and has questionable effectiveness on the battlefield. The focus has now shifted to more advanced systems like the Shaheen missile and the Ababeel missile, which has a range of over 2,200 kilometers and the capability to carry multiple warheads. Experts argue that Pakistan cannot compete with India's missile capabilities, making these advanced systems crucial for Pakistan's deterrence strategy. However, the cost of testing and maintaining these systems is significant, leading to a financial imbalance in the country. Pakistan's skewed priorities, favoring military advancements over economic welfare, have dire consequences, such as the near-collapse of PIA. The government is now pushing to privatize PIA, but the dire state of the airline raises doubts about its viability. Despite the economic turmoil, Pakistan continues its missile tests, highlighting the misplaced priorities of the government. This focus on military ambitions, driven by an imagined external threat from India, has led to an unnecessary and financially crippling arms race. These misplaced priorities are pushing Pakistan further into financial turmoil.

The ongoing conflict between Israel and Hamas has had a devastating impact on both sides, with over 5,500 people dead and tens of thousands displaced or injured. The economic cost of the war is also significant, with Israel's economy taking a hit. The country's growth rate is projected to contract by at least two to three percent in the third and fourth quarters, and the budget deficit is likely to rise. Additionally, the Israeli currency, the shekel, has fallen to an eight-year low against the U.S. dollar. This war is testing Israel's resilience, as it has historically maintained a robust economy despite conflicts. The military has been given priority, with 360,000 reservists called up and leaving their jobs, causing disruptions in various sectors. Border towns like Sderot have seen a mass exodus of residents, turning them into ghost towns. Economists and ratings agencies are closely monitoring these developments, with warnings that Israel's debt could be downgraded. The World Bank has also issued warnings about the potential global impact of this conflict, particularly on oil prices. Wars in West Asia have historically disrupted energy markets and caused spikes in oil prices. Overall, this ongoing conflict highlights the challenges and instability facing the world as it grapples with the complexities of the Israel-Hamas issue.

### [Vantage | Why Israel-Hamas war has tied Erdogan in knots](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/vantage-why-israel-hamas-war-has-tied-erdogan-in-knots-13296872.html)

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is facing a difficult situation in the Israel-Hamas conflict. He wants to be seen as a great leader and champion of Muslims, but also needs to support Western allies and maintain good relations with Israel. Erdogan has taken a balanced approach, blaming both sides for the conflict and calling for a stop to the violence. Turkey has also been involved in diplomatic efforts to secure the release of hostages and maintain contacts with Hamas. However, Erdogan is facing pressure from Western allies to sever ties with Hamas, which he is unlikely to do. In an effort to placate the West, Turkey has offered its support for Sweden's accession to NATO. This conflict highlights the challenges and complexities of the Israel-Hamas issue and the need for global governance reform.

Despite talks of de-escalation between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping in August, China has not committed to any withdrawal. Instead, it has been boosting its military infrastructure in the region. The report also mentions that India is aware of the threat posed by China and maintains similar troop levels. Overall, the report confirms that China's threat is growing and long-term.

### [Why West lecturing India on Canadian diplomats smacks of hypocrisy](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-west-lecturing-india-on-canadian-diplomats-smacks-of-hypocrisy-13296282.html)

The article discusses the recent tensions between India and Canada regarding the size of their respective diplomatic missions. Under the Vienna Convention, the host country has the right to determine the size of foreign missions on its soil, based on the bilateral ties between the countries. India has taken action against Canada due to its alleged tolerance of anti-India activities by pro-"Khalistani" extremist Sikhs on Canadian soil. India has demanded parity in the number of diplomats stationed in each other's country and has expelled Canadian diplomats who did not comply. Canada has criticized India's actions, but India argues that it has the right to enforce its demand under the Vienna Convention. The US and UK have also voiced support for Canada, which India sees as interference in a bilateral matter. The author highlights the double standards and hypocrisy of Western countries in their treatment of non-Western countries.

The relationship between China and Nepal has been complicated since they established diplomatic ties in 1955. China has been using tactics like debt traps to gain control over smaller nations, including Nepal. China has made significant infrastructure investments in Nepal, increasing its dependence on Chinese funding. However, there are deep-rooted problems between the two countries that have infringed on Nepal's territorial, cultural, and political integrity. Nepal has seen a rise in anti-China sentiment, with many activist groups protesting against the government's policies. China's ambassador to Nepal has faced scrutiny for comments on Nepal's internal issues and relations with India. The BRI projects in Nepal have seen little progress, causing frustration and concerns about China's intentions. Nepal is seeking economic investment without geopolitical strings attached. The recent visit of Nepalese officials to Beijing resulted in agreements to enhance bilateral cooperation, including trade and investment. However, the lack of progress on BRI implementation and concerns about debt traps and trade deficits with China continue to be major concerns for Nepal. The road ahead for China and Nepal is not without challenges.

China's Foreign Minister, Wang Yi, has urged Bhutan to settle its border dispute with China and establish formal diplomatic relations. The border issue between Bhutan and China dates back to the 1940s and 50s when China laid claims to land controlled by Bhutan after annexing Tibet. The disputed region of Doklam, which is currently controlled by Bhutan but not recognized by China, is a major concern for India as it is located close to India's Siliguri corridor, which connects mainland India to the Northeast. India fears that any land exchange between Bhutan and China could involve Doklam, potentially threatening India's security. Additionally, Bhutan's consideration of establishing formal relations with China instead of relying on its historical partnership with India has raised questions about India's role in the negotiations.

"The Great Resignation" refers to the mass exodus from the workforce that occurred during the pandemic. In 2021, a record number of individuals, 47 million in the United States alone, decided to quit their jobs. While the overall quit rate is now approaching pre-pandemic levels, CEOs are experiencing a different trend. More than 1,400 top executives have left their positions this year, marking the highest figure in two decades. Factors contributing to CEO resignations include a desire for a more balanced family life, retirement of the baby boomer generation, poor performance or ethical concerns, and demands for change from boards and stakeholders. This phenomenon is not limited to the US but is being observed globally. CEO tenure has decreased from an average of 12 years a few decades ago to approximately five to seven years today.

The aftermath of the Israel-Hamas conflict has raised concerns about the spillover effect in West Asia, particularly for the United States. Recent incidents involving US forces in Syria and Iraq have highlighted potential threats to US interests in the region. There have been a series of drone attacks on US forces, with five occurring in just one week. These attacks have taken place in both Syria and Iraq, causing concern for the safety of American troops stationed there. While there have been no fatalities, the incidents serve as a reminder of the risks faced by US personnel in the region. President Joe Biden was called away from an event on the US economy to address the situation in the White House Situation Room, indicating its seriousness. The US government has blamed Iranian proxies for these attacks and warned of potential retaliation, but Iran denies responsibility and accuses Biden of contributing to the escalation of the Israel-Gaza conflict. The targeting of US forces raises significant concerns for regional and global security, and the response from both the US and Iran will play a crucial role in determining stability in West Asia.

Former Pakistani Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has made a dramatic comeback to Pakistan after four years. He was welcomed by his brother and the current Prime Minister, Shehbaz Sharif, and they headed to a rally in Lahore via helicopter. During the rally, Nawaz Sharif broke down while hugging his daughter on stage, and there was a fireworks display. In his speech, Sharif portrayed himself as a man wronged by the system and expressed his desire to help Pakistan. However, his biggest political rival, Imran Khan, is still in jail. The author suggests that Sharif's return is a result of a deal with the army, and he may receive more judicial help to make him eligible to contest in the upcoming elections. Sharif also talked about the need for better relations with neighboring countries like India and Afghanistan. The author questions whether this message is a personal objective or if it was influenced by the army. While Sharif praised Bangladesh during his speech, he did not provide specific solutions for Pakistan's domestic challenges such as its economic crisis and high poverty rates. The article concludes that Sharif's comeback is a symptom of Pakistan's lack of consistency in leadership and sound policies.

Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is facing backlash for his handling of foreign policy, particularly in relation to India. After accusing India of killing a Khalistani, tensions have escalated between the two countries. Canada has pulled out 41 of its 62 diplomats from India, leading to a suspension of visa services at three locations. India has rejected Canada's accusations and emphasized that the suspension is temporary and could be lifted if relations improve. Trudeau's actions are not only causing issues with India but also with other countries, as seen in his recent visit to a mosque in Toronto after offering unconditional support to Israel. The Canadian opposition leader has criticized Trudeau's handling of the situation and polls suggest he could become the next prime minister. The author suggests that Trudeau started this conflict and it is up to him to end it before facing consequences at the polling booths.

China has deployed six warships to West Asia, including three warships in the Gulf and another three that escorted a cargo ship from Panama. The purpose of their presence is unclear, but experts speculate it could be for the protection of Chinese citizens or to secure shipping lanes and ensure a steady supply of oil, as China is a major importer of crude oil from the region. China's economy is already struggling, and a disruption in oil supply would worsen the situation. In an effort to contain the war between Israel and Hamas, China has sent a peace envoy to the region and called for an immediate ceasefire. China has been expanding its influence in West Asia and successfully mediated between Iran and Saudi Arabia. However, this current conflict highlights the limitations of China's diplomacy.

### [Vantage | 17 days of Hamas-Israel war explained in 5 questions](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/vantage-17-days-of-hamas-israel-war-explained-in-5-questions-13289042.html)

After 17 days of war between Israel and Gaza, the situation is worsening. Israeli airstrikes continue to target Gaza, but there has been no ground invasion yet. This article addresses five key questions to understand the current state of the conflict.

Question 1: What is happening in Gaza? The situation in Gaza is dire. Israel claims to have struck 320 targets in 24 hours, including Hamas launchpads and command centers. However, civilian targets have also been hit, causing significant harm to the people of Gaza. The death toll has exceeded 5,000, with around 40% being children. Injuries are also rising, with over 15,000 Gazans wounded. Aid convoys have started entering Gaza, but the amount of aid provided is still far below what is needed.

Question 2: What is Israel's next move? Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Israel's border with Lebanon and outlined his plan to eradicate Hamas and end its rule in Gaza. A ground invasion is considered necessary to achieve this objective. Limited raids have already been carried out, and a full-scale invasion is expected to be much more intense. The defense minister mentioned a possible timeline of one to three months for the operation.

Question 3: What are Israel's allies doing? Several world leaders, including the Italian Prime Minister, Dutch Prime Minister, and French President, have visited Israel to show solidarity. However, there are indications that Western leaders are changing their stance. While they continue to support Israel's right to defend itself, there are calls for a humanitarian pause to allow aid distribution. A virtual meeting was held among leaders of the US, Canada, France, the UK, Italy, and Germany, where they reiterated their support for Israel but also emphasized the need to protect civilians.

Question 4: What is the situation at Israel's northern front? The tension has increased along Israel's border with Lebanon, with Israeli strikes targeting Hezbollah sites. Airports in Syria were also hit. The fear is that if Hezbollah joins the war, it could escalate the conflict and involve Western countries. Western leaders are keen to avoid this outcome.

Question 5: What has been the global response? Pro-Palestine protests have been taking place not only in Muslim-majority countries but also in Western cities. Demonstrations, some of which turned violent, have been held in Denmark, Berlin, Paris, and London. These protests are influencing global opinion, with countries expressing concern over civilian casualties and providing aid to Gaza.

The situation is complex, and there are no easy choices. Israel faces the challenge of balancing foreign and domestic support in its decision-making. The conflict has broader implications for the region and the world, with potential impacts on trade and global stability.
