### [Why a Chinese report on American hands in regime changes is worth considering](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-a-chinese-report-on-american-hands-in-regime-changes-is-worth-considering-13806543.html)

The Chinese Foreign Ministry report "The National Endowment for Democracy: What It Is and What It Does?" criticizes the NED for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. 

The report alleges that the NED supports pro-US forces, manipulates elections, and incites division to undermine stability. It specifically accuses the NED of funding Uyghur and Tibetan groups considered anti-state by China, citing financial support to organizations like the World Uyghur Congress and individuals like Hidayet Oguzhan and Rushan Abbas. 

The report also highlights articles published in the Journal of Democracy, a publication associated with the NED, that question the effectiveness of Indian democracy. 


China calls on countries to be aware of the NED's true intentions and protect their national sovereignty and interests.

### [How social inequality fuels ‘godmen’ culture](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-social-inequality-fuels-godmen-culture-13806496.html)

This article discusses the alarming rise of exploitative "godmen" in India,  highlighting their abuse of power and wealth. 

While India boasts genuine saints who promote inner peace and selflessness, a  disconcerting number of self-proclaimed gurus exploit poverty, caste inequality, and superstition for personal gain. 

Examples like Bhole Baba, Asaram Bapu, and Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh demonstrate how these figures amass wealth, influence, and impunity, often securing political protection despite accusations of sexual assault, murder, and other crimes.  The article argues that the root causes of this phenomenon are India's deep-seated social problems, including  caste discrimination and economic disparity, which make vulnerable populations susceptible to their manipulative tactics.  The author emphasizes the need for comprehensive social and economic reforms to address the underlying issues and prevent continued exploitation.

### [Could Moneyball methodology improve Indian cricket?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/could-moneyball-methodology-improve-indian-cricket-13806487.html)

The Indian Premier League (IPL), a driving force behind India's cricketing success, uses awards and rankings to recognize player performance. However, the current system relies on limited and questionable metrics. 

Analyzing IPL data, a group of students developed a new Most Valuable Player (MVP) formula based on multivariate regression. This new system considers batting efficiency and consistency, bowling control and wicket-taking, and fielding impact, leading to a stronger correlation between MVP scores and team win percentages.  

The revised metrics highlight the importance of strike rate, economy rate, and fielding contributions, offering a more comprehensive assessment of player value. This Moneyball approach could elevate the competition within the IPL and potentially contribute to India's dominance in world cricket.

Bangladesh is facing a critical period of instability following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation and the government's move to designate Islamist groups as militant organizations. This has led to violence, the resurgence of extremist groups like Jama'at Mujahideen Bangladesh and Ansar-al Islam, and a rise in sectarian tensions.

International players, including Pakistan and potentially the US, are suspected to be meddling in Bangladesh's internal affairs, seeking to exploit the situation for their strategic gains.  India, concerned about potential spillover effects on its security, needs to remain vigilant and supportive of efforts to maintain stability in Bangladesh.  


The situation highlights the fragility of Bangladesh's social fabric and the potential for further violence if extremist forces gain a foothold.

China and the Philippines continue to clash over territorial claims in the South China Sea, despite a recent understanding aimed at reducing tensions.  Chinese coast guard vessels are increasingly engaging in aggressive maneuvers around the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, including ramming and water cannon attacks on Philippine supply ships.  

China asserts historical sovereignty over the region, while the Philippines relies on the 2016 UNCLOS Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling that invalidated China's 9-dash-line claim. 

Recent developments, including a renewed Philippines-US Mutual Defence Treaty and a Philippine commitment to pursue lawful activities in the disputed waters, suggest the Philippines is taking a stronger stance against Chinese pressure. Beijing needs to adapt its strategy, recognizing the Philippines' increased assertiveness and the limitations of its deterrence tactics.

The article examines accusations of US covert regime change efforts in Bangladesh, focusing on the strategic motivation behind such actions and their potential consequences. 

The strategic importance of Bangladesh's location, particularly its ports and access to the Bay of Bengal, is highlighted as a reason for potential US interest in influencing the country's political landscape. The article draws comparisons to past US interventions, such as the 1953 coup in Iran and the 2014 Maidan Revolution in Ukraine, emphasizing the potential for instability and unforeseen repercussions. 

Drawing on historical examples and academic research, the article argues that while regime change may seem like a strategic advantage in the short term, it often leads to long-term instability, weakens democratic institutions, and triggers resentment among the populace. 


Finally, the article underscores the potential risks this intervention poses to Bangladesh and the region, urging India and other stakeholders to closely monitor the situation and work towards maintaining regional stability.

Ukraine's surprise ground offensive into Russia's Kursk region has captured international attention. This audacious move, involving the seizure of significant territory, has shifted the narrative of the war and created a strategic dilemma for Russia. 

The Ukrainian operation raises several questions: What are Ukraine's aims - to weaken Russia's forces, gain leverage in potential negotiations, or something else?  How will Russia respond? Will it escalate the conflict, try to repel the incursion, or use the situation to pressure for negotiations?  The success of this operation, as well as its potential consequences, remains to be seen.

The author cites events like the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Israel-Hamas war, and political instability in various regions as examples of this present crisis.  Echoing Sri Aurobindo, the article emphasizes the need for India to stay true to its values of personal freedom and decentralized governance, urging bold policies and increased innovation.  India is positioned to navigate this turbulent era by staying independent of global pressures and focusing on its own strengths.

They also point to the low likelihood of India, which currently wins few medals, being successful in hosting the Olympics profitably. Instead, the author proposes focusing on building grassroots sports infrastructure to develop a stronger sporting culture at the national level before considering a bid to host the Olympics.

### [Why PM Modi's visit Ukraine and Poland will be closely watched](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-pm-modis-visit-ukraine-and-poland-will-be-closely-watched-13805817.html)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Poland and Ukraine marks a significant diplomatic move, as it is the first time an Indian PM has visited Poland in 40 years. 

Modi aims to build stronger ties with both countries, focusing on defense and strategic alignment with Poland.  His visit to Ukraine follows a controversial trip to Russia, where he received Russia's highest civilian honor. 

India seeks to establish a mediating role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, while also pursuing bilateral economic interests.  The relationship with Ukraine is marked by historical ties, trade agreements, and India's support for Ukraine's territorial integrity. Meanwhile, India’s relationship with Poland is witnessing a resurgence, with increasing defense collaboration and trade partnerships.


Modi's visit comes at a delicate time, with Poland being a staunch supporter of Ukraine and critical of India's continued engagement with Russia.

The article argues that US foreign policy, particularly its interventions in other countries, has often been detrimental.  

The author points to instances like Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Iran, where US-backed regime changes resulted in instability and suffering. The piece criticizes the US for prioritizing its own interests over genuine diplomacy and supporting anti-government groups, even those with questionable backgrounds or ties to radical ideologies. 

The recent coup in Bangladesh is used as a case study, alleging that US involvement in undermining the elected government has contributed to a rise in extremism and instability in the region. Comparing the US approach to India’s more conservative foreign policy, the author suggests that the US’s focus on regime change often backfires, leaving countries worse off and serving its own strategic goals at the expense of democracy and human rights.

The article discusses how Western media, driven by powerful interests, manipulates narratives to shape public opinion.  It highlights the speed and efficiency of this manipulation in the digital age, citing examples like the sudden change in portrayal of figures like Manuel Noriega and Sheikh Hasina.  The author argues that platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Wikipedia, driven by algorithms and potentially biased editors, contribute to this process, creating a system of "truth by repeated assertion." The author concludes by advocating for a drastic solution, emulating the Chinese firewall to protect against Western influence and fostering indigenous knowledge systems.

Following a military-engineered coup, Sheikh Hasina, the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, sought refuge in India. Charges of murder and other crimes have been brought against her, but these lack substantial legal grounding and were filed after her departure.  India, which enjoys strong diplomatic ties with Bangladesh, is unlikely to extradite Hasina, given her past contributions to the country's stability and economic growth. India is also concerned about potential human rights violations and the safety of Bangladeshi Hindus following the coup. It remains to be seen how the new interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, will manage the situation and whether it has the legitimacy to pursue Hasina's extradition. India's position is crucial for Bangladesh's security and economic well-being, and any strain in relations could benefit rival powers.

India, despite its progress, remains home to the largest number of child brides globally, with one in three residing in the country. Child marriage, primarily affecting girls in rural areas and poorer households, leads to pregnancy complications, limited education opportunities, and long-term social and psychological consequences.  

While acknowledging government efforts to curb this practice, child rights activist Bhuwan Ribhu emphasizes the need for stronger legal action, societal awareness, and political will. He highlights the importance of investing in education for girls, prosecuting all those involved in child marriages, and creating a child-centric community. Ribhu proposes the PICKET strategy, focusing on Policy, Investment, Convergence, Knowledge, Ecosystem, and Technology, as a roadmap to end child marriage in India and ultimately contribute to a global solution.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced his resignation as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), citing declining popularity and ongoing scandals as key factors. Kishida's approval ratings have plummeted to record lows, and his attempts to address internal party issues and financial irregularities have been met with public criticism. 

He hopes his resignation will pave the way for a new LDP leader with a fresh image to unite the party and improve its standing with voters ahead of the next general election in 2025. Several potential candidates, including former defense minister Ishiba Shigeru and current digital minister Kono Taro, are vying for the leadership position. The race is expected to be competitive, with the winner becoming the next prime minister of Japan due to the LDP's majority in the Diet.

Despite the instability in South Asia, India is experiencing economic growth and presents a significant opportunity for the region. India's robust 7% growth rate and strategic reforms are attracting foreign investment, making it a prime destination for businesses compared to its struggling neighbors. 

China's infrastructure-heavy investment model has proven ineffective, leaving countries like Pakistan with unsustainable debt.  Meanwhile, other South Asian nations like Bangladesh and Nepal face economic and political challenges.   Continued political resistance to collaborating with India risks perpetuating poverty in the region. Ultimately, engaging with India's economic prowess is essential for South Asian prosperity.

The recent change in leadership in Bangladesh, following a student-led upheaval, has significant strategic implications for India and the region.  The political instability stems from rising dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's authoritarianism and economic decline. This situation marks a departure from the strong civil-military relations Bangladesh has seen since its independence. 
The article highlights the country's long history of military intervention in politics and the challenges of defining national identity, particularly in terms of secularism versus Islamism.  The instability in Bangladesh could impact India-Bangladesh relations, potentially jeopardizing the progress made in trade, connectivity, and defence cooperation. Moreover, a destabilized Bangladesh could weaken BIMSTEC and pose a broader security challenge to India, as it borders five Indian states.

India's initiatives include the Global South Centre of Excellence, the Global South Scholarship Programme, and the Global South Young Diplomats Forum, all aimed at strengthening South-South cooperation and building capacity. The summits seek to create  sustainable solutions and reduce dependence on external aid, promoting indigenous developmental models and leveraging India's digital public infrastructure expertise.

ISRO successfully launched its Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) on its third and final development flight, marking the vehicle as fully operational. This launch is significant as it allows ISRO to capture the growing market for launching small satellites, a niche previously served by the larger and more expensive Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV).

### [Why India should worry about a Kamala Harris presidency](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-india-should-worry-about-a-kamala-harris-presidency-13805290.html)

A Harris presidency could significantly harm US-India relations, deviating from the bipartisan consensus that has characterized the relationship since 2001.  The author argues that Harris's potential foreign policy approach, influenced by the Democratic party's progressive wing and online activism, would prioritize Hinduphobia, denigration of Indian democracy, and Khalistan separatism, undermining the interests of Indian Americans who generally support strong US-India ties.  

The author contrasts Harris with Biden's administration, which has navigated sensitive issues with India diplomatically. They contend that Harris, unlike Biden, would be more susceptible to pressure from human rights groups and left-leaning bureaucrats, leading to a more adversarial relationship with India.   
  
A Harris presidency, according to the author, could result in the worst crises in US-India relations since the Clinton administration and the actions of Henry Kissinger.

The arrest of former Pakistani ISI chief Faiz Hameed signals a concerning trend within the Pakistani army.  Hameed, known for his role in various political interventions and alleged corruption, is now accused of treason, highlighting the increasing paranoia within military ranks. 

This move by the current Army Chief, Gen. Asim Munir, marks a departure from past norms by targeting his own officers. The arrest of Hameed is expected to trigger a domino effect, potentially involving other senior officials, including former Army Chief Qamar Bajwa. This internal strife within the army raises serious questions about its stability and governance. The army's reputation for discipline and integrity, once a cornerstone of its authority, appears to be eroding due to frequent military involvement in politics and endemic corruption. The situation presents a significant challenge for Pakistan's security and stability, and demands careful attention from India as it considers any future engagements with its volatile neighbour.

Although the recent change in leadership in Bangladesh, with the 'pro-India' Sheikh Hasina ousted, has led to some pessimism in India, a history of pragmatic diplomacy shows that engagement is key. The article uses the example of the Maldives, where anti-India sentiments initially led to tensions, ultimately followed by a turnaround and renewed cooperation.  

India's consistent support, including development assistance and debt relief, proved crucial in mitigating the Maldives' economic difficulties, leading to a shift in the political landscape. The author suggests that a similar pattern might emerge in Bangladesh, highlighting India's continued engagement with both the new government and members of the previous regime. 


The shared economic, security, and developmental interests between India and Bangladesh are undeniable, making sustained engagement vital for long-term regional stability and prosperity.

The article discusses the violent attack on RG Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata by a mob following the rape and murder of a trainee doctor. Eyewitness accounts and reports suggest the police remained largely inactive, with officers offering minimal resistance and even seeking refuge while the mob vandalized the premises. 

The article criticizes the state government's handling of the situation, alleging a cover-up of administrative lapses. The Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee, has claimed that the perpetrators were BJP and DYFI workers, but the author questions her assertion. The Calcutta High Court has transferred the case to the CBI, given the lack of progress and concerns about evidence tampering.  The  author calls for accountability and transparency from the government, emphasizing the need to address the concerns of women who feel vulnerable and endangered in light of the horrific crime.

China's economic growth is slowing, raising concerns among policymakers and investors. Despite a 20-point plan to stabilize and boost the economy, growth in the second quarter of 2024 fell short of expectations.  

Several challenges contribute to this slowdown, including trade tensions, a debt crisis in the corporate sector, a cooling property market, and a struggling manufacturing sector.  Furthermore, China faces an aging population, the need for state-owned enterprise reform, and competition with the West in emerging technologies.

There are worries that China may fall into the middle-income trap, a situation where growth stalls preventing a country from reaching high-income status.  To avoid this, sustained growth rates of 6-7% are needed, making the current trend a serious concern for Chinese leaders who rely on economic prosperity for their legitimacy.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned following mass protests sparked by the reinstatement of a quota system for government jobs. The protests, initially student-led, escalated into a nationwide movement against Hasina's government, exposing issues of corruption and authoritarianism. General Waker Uz Zaman, the Chief of Army Staff, declared a military takeover, released opposition leader Khalida Zia from house arrest, and appointed Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus as the head of an interim government. The interim government faces the challenge of restoring peace and preparing for new elections.  

The political landscape in Bangladesh is shifting, with potential geopolitical implications for neighboring countries like India and Pakistan.

In 1946, a mutiny within the Royal Indian Navy erupted in Bombay, fueled by poor treatment, working conditions, and the desire for independence.  Spreading to other bases across India, the mutiny received widespread support from the local population. The British, facing an unprecedented level of resistance from their own forces, realized the precariousness of their rule. 

The uprising, likened to the Indian Rebellion of 1857 by the British High Commissioner John Freeman, significantly hastened the British departure from India. Though some national leaders distanced themselves from the mutiny, its impact was undeniable, demonstrating the widespread discontent and solidifying the path towards independence. However, the potential for uniting the nation under a single movement for freedom was ultimately squandered.

The ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, now over ten months old, has escalated into regional conflicts involving Hezbollah, Iran-backed militias, and even Iran itself. 

Israel, emboldened by its technological superiority, has assassinated key Hamas and Hezbollah leaders, claiming to weaken their capabilities. This, however, has increased the risk of a wider war, potentially drawing in Iran and its proxies. The international community, including Israel's allies, have criticized Israel's actions, particularly the high civilian casualties in Gaza, and have accused Israel of potential genocide. 

While Israel believes its  integrations with Arab states would have marginalized extremist groups, the Palestinian conflict remains its biggest challenge.  The lack of peace and deep-seated trauma on both sides make finding a solution increasingly difficult.

The article discusses the rapid shift in public perception surrounding Kamala Harris, from being viewed as a liability to becoming a symbol of hope for democracy and liberalism. 

Despite low approval ratings and previous criticism, Harris is now praised by media outlets that once condemned her. The article attributes this shift to a carefully orchestrated narrative campaign, particularly in light of Donald Trump's presidency and the perceived threat he poses to the established order. 

Harris's perceived competence and her alignment with progressive figures like Bernie Sanders and Ilham Omar raise concerns about potential changes in U.S. foreign policy, particularly concerning India and Israel. 

The article concludes by highlighting the manipulation of narratives in elections, using Trump and the recent Indian elections as examples, and suggests that the world faces uncertain times ahead.

The ousting of Sheikh Hasina from power in Bangladesh following protests sparked by a quota system reinstatement has created a tense situation. Bangladesh's interim government, headed by Muhammed Yunus, has been met with violence and a backlash against minorities, particularly Hindus. 

The BNP and the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), known for its links to Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war atrocities and its support for establishing an Islamic state, are seen as influential forces in this new political landscape.  India is closely monitoring the situation, concerned about  JeI's potential to destabilize the region and its ties to global jihadi organizations.  With potential for unrest and democratic backsliding, India faces the challenge of supporting democratic processes and protecting the interests of minorities in Bangladesh while navigating the evolving political dynamics.

The Pakistani military took the unprecedented step of arresting and charging former ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed with violating the Pakistan Army Act, both before and after his retirement. This action, initiated by the current Army Chief Gen Asim Munir, stems from a Supreme Court order regarding allegations of extortion against Hameed.

The timing of the arrest, shortly after Pakistan celebrated javelin thrower Arshad Nadeem's historic Olympic gold medal, highlights the internal power struggle within Pakistan.  Mushir argues that the arrest overshadows the national jubilation and reflects Pakistan's ongoing turmoil. He further connects the arrest to a broader pattern of military interference in attempts at peace with India, citing past instances under Prime Ministers Vajpayee and Modi.

### [Budget and after: Time to prioritise agriculture, health and education](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/budget-and-after-time-to-prioritise-agriculture-health-and-education-13804261.html)

To achieve the vision of Viksit Bharat, India needs to address the needs of those at the bottom of the economic pyramid. Despite being the fifth largest economy, India's per capita income is low and the benefits of growth are unequally distributed. 

Agriculture, employing a large portion of the population, requires significant attention. Stagnant growth in the sector necessitates investment in technology, infrastructure, R&D, and value addition through food processing.  Subsidies and social safety nets, while crucial, should be complemented by initiatives that empower farmers and increase their incomes.   

Focusing on agriculture, health, and education as key priorities will benefit the majority of the population and drive inclusive growth, creating a stronger foundation for sustainable progress.

### [How regime change in Bangladesh is an immediate setback for India in the neighbourhood](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-regime-change-in-bangladesh-is-an-immediate-setback-for-india-in-the-neighbourhood-13804241.html)

Following the ousting of Sheikh Hasina's government by a student-led movement, an interim government led by Muhammed Yunus has taken charge. While Yunus enjoys international recognition for his work with Grameen Bank, he is politically aligned against Hasina, facing charges of violating labour laws.

Concerns for India center around restoring stability, safeguarding the Hindu minority now vulnerable to anti-Indian and Islamic elements, and addressing the possibility of closer relations between Bangladesh and China. 

China's growing influence in Bangladesh, already evident through the Belt and Road Initiative and military partnerships, is a cause for concern for India.  The US has been critical of Hasina's government on democratic grounds, a stance that differs from India's, and has not explicitly addressed the security of minorities in Bangladesh. This divergence in approach between the US and India regarding Bangladesh highlights a potential strategic disconnect.

### [Human rights debacle in Britain: West must end double standard](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/human-rights-debacle-in-britain-west-must-end-double-standard-13804133.html)

This article critiques the West's double standard on human rights. It argues that while Western media and governments are quick to condemn human rights abuses in the Global South, they are silent or dismissive when similar issues occur within their own borders or allies.  

The article cites examples of anti-immigrant riots in the UK, US and Canadian actions in Belarus and Gaza as evidence of this hypocrisy. It also points to reports by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International detailing human rights violations within the UK, US and Canada, emphasizing disregard for these reports by respective governments.  The author calls for greater vocalization of these issues by the Global South to expose this hypocrisy and urge Western powers to adopt consistent human rights standards.

The recent political turmoil in Bangladesh, triggered by the ousting of Sheikh Hasina, presents a complex geopolitical challenge for India.  

Bangladesh's importance to India stems from its strategic location, cultural ties, and shared interests. However, the vacuum created by Hasina's exit risks influencing regional stability and could potentially see a rise in radical Islamist activities. 

Both China and the US are vying for influence in Bangladesh, presenting India with a strategic balancing act. While China offers economic and military incentives, India must leverage its historical ties and geographical proximity to maintain a positive relationship.  

India must engage diplomatically with the interim government in Bangladesh, emphasizing shared concerns regarding China, terrorism, and minority rights. Additionally, ensuring the safety of Indian citizens and Hindus in Bangladesh, monitoring borders, and continuing to cooperate on regional security initiatives are paramount.

Ahead of his visit to Kyiv, Prime Minister Modi's trip to Ukraine is viewed as a crucial step in navigating a shifting global order.  The visit comes amid heightened global tensions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a growing strategic alliance between Russia and China. India seeks to maintain strategic autonomy, balancing its relationships with both the US-led West and the China-Russia bloc.  

Recent engagements between India and China, including conciliatory statements on border issues and a tentative thaw in economic ties, suggest a potential for greater cooperation.  This realignment could be driven by China's need to find new markets and India's emergence as a significant economic power. Modi's meeting with Zelenskyy will likely focus on addressing the ongoing conflict and India's role as a potential mediator within the fractured world order.

Kamala Harris's political ascent has been rapid, propelled by a combination of opportunity and shrewd maneuvering. Since being named Biden's running mate, she rose to the candidacy with remarkable energy and organization, uniting the Democratic party behind her.  

She has successfully challenged Donald Trump's dominance in polls and mobilized a significant financial resource for her campaign. Harris's message focuses on safeguarding democracy and advocating for the middle class, women's rights, and gun safety. Despite facing a formidable opponent in Trump, her campaign approach, coupled with his own struggles, has shifted the tide of the 2024 election race.

The article argues that India's Waqf Act, designed to protect Muslim religious and charitable endowments, is discriminatory and outdated. 

The author contends that the Act, established after Independence, has been progressively amended to favor Waqf Boards and grant them unfettered power over waqf properties, even those claimed by non-Muslims. 

They highlight provisions that allow the Waqf Board to determine if property is waqf, are exempt from statutes of limitations, and allow it to encompass non-Muslim dedications. The author criticizes the Muslim-dominated composition of these Boards and contrasts their autonomy with state oversight of Hindu temples.  

The article concludes by calling for the amendment of the Waqf Act, arguing that its current form undermines secularism and promotes an "apartheid" system against the majority population.

### [How Bangladesh crisis resembles closely with West-orchestrated ‘colour revolutions’ and Arab Spring](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-bangladesh-crisis-resembles-closely-with-west-orchestrated-colour-revolutions-and-arab-spring-13803791.html)

The recent coup in Bangladesh, orchestrated by the military with support from radical Islamist parties like Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) has raised concerns about the future of democracy in the country. The ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who oversaw significant socio-economic progress,  paves the way for an unstable political landscape. This coup, reminiscent of "colour revolutions" in Eurasia and the Arab Spring, could lead to the rise of a theocratic state.

The interim government, led by Muhammad Yunus, is likely to face immense challenges as the powerful BNP, JeI, and the military seek dominance.  Khaleda Zia, the BNP leader, is expected to resist Yunus's authority, further complicating the situation. The coup is also a major threat to Bangladesh's minority Hindu population, who have faced persecution in the past. The fragile peace and stability of Bangladesh hang in the balance as the nation navigates this turbulent political transition.

Hindus in Bangladesh face chronic fear and insecurity due to prevalent violence and discrimination.  Since 1947, their population has significantly dwindled, now standing at approximately 8%. 

They are routinely targeted during religious celebrations like Durga Puja, with unfounded rumors often leading to attacks on temples and communities, resulting in deaths, and horrific acts of sexual violence against women. The government's response to these atrocities is often inadequate, perpetuating a cycle of impunity for the perpetrators. 

This systematic persecution, met by deafening silence from the international community, threatens the very fabric of Bangladeshi society. Urgent action is required to protect the Hindu community and ensure their safety and dignity.

Hamas, despite the substantial damage inflicted by the Israeli operation, remains a potent force. Its recruitment efforts are bolstered by Israel's actions, with anger and frustration among Gazans providing fertile ground for radicalization.  Hamas's transition to guerrilla tactics, utilizing its intricate tunnel network and urban knowledge, presents a significant challenge for the IDF, who are unaccustomed to prolonged urban warfare. 

The organization's 'beehive' leadership structure ensures continuity even amidst losses. Although militarily weakened, Hamas's resilience stems from its deep roots in the Palestinian population, which view them as defenders against Israeli occupation. Hamas's success, however, comes at a high cost for the Palestinian people, who are trapped in a cycle of violence and suffering.

President Droupadi Murmu's state visit to Timor-Leste, a first for an Indian head of state, signifies growing strategic importance for India.  Timor-Leste recently became an ASEAN observer and aims to be a full member soon, making it a key player in India's Act East Policy. 

India intends to open a resident mission in Dili, reciprocating Timor-Leste's likely future mission in New Delhi. The visit saw cultural and diplomatic exchanges, including a high-level welcome, the bestowal of Timor-Leste's highest honor on President Murmu, and a televised interview on President Horta's popular show.  

Three Memorandums of Understanding were signed, focusing on cultural cooperation, visa-free access for diplomats, and broadcasting collaboration.  The visit opens doors for enhanced development cooperation through ASEAN-India funds and reinforces the potential for economic partnerships, particularly in sectors like education and healthcare.

Bangladesh is going through a major political shift following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.  Noebel laureate Muhammad Yunus leads an interim government while efforts are made to restore order and prepare for new elections.  

However, the rise of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party, which has ties to militancy, poses a threat to Bangladesh's secular foundation and India's security interests. The party's resurgence could lead to an increase in anti-India sentiment, cross-border terrorism, and instability in the region. Additionally, the growing influence of China and Pakistan in Bangladesh complicates the situation further, challenging India's regional standing.

AI's growing integration into criminal activities presents a significant threat. Deepfakes enable disinformation, while AI-powered phishing and social engineering attacks are increasingly sophisticated.  Cybercriminals use AI to identify vulnerabilities and launch targeted attacks, and AI-driven malware adapts rapidly to evade detection.  

The autonomous nature of AI complicates traditional liability models, making it challenging to assign responsibility for crimes involving artificial agents.  

Addressing this challenge requires a multifaceted approach: international cooperation to establish AI development norms, a revised legal framework that considers AI's unique characteristics, investments in AI for detecting and mitigating criminal AI, and fostering an ethical AI culture.

The article argues against an uncritical acceptance of student protesters as inherently positive forces.  While acknowledging their historical heroism, it cites examples of student movements that have been morally corrupt, naive, or even dangerous.  

The author points to instances like the Students for a Democratic Society in the 1960s, the Red Brigades in Italy, and  certain student movements in India,  to illustrate how student activism can be manipulated by external forces or result in harmful actions.  The article concludes by emphasizing the need to critically evaluate student protests rather than blindly assuming their noble intentions.

Recent violence and turmoil in Bangladesh have highlighted the dire situation for the Hindu minority.  The exodus of Sheikh Hasina and the rise of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami, which has strong historical ties to Pakistan and anti-Bangladesh sentiments, have led to targeted attacks on Hindus. 

The events in Bangladesh shatter the myth of Bengali nationalism as a unifying force, exposing the fragility of cultural and linguistic unity in the face of religious extremism. This underscores the global persecution of Hindus, who have been increasingly marginalized and targeted for their faith. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in India, which offers refuge to persecuted minorities, becomes even more relevant in light of these events.

The  Rod Marathas are a community based in Haryana, with origins tracing back to the aftermath of the Battle of Panipat in 1761.  After the Maratha defeat,  a few hundred soldiers and non-combatants managed to escape and settled in the region, giving rise to this distinct community. 

Today, the Rod Marathas share cultural similarities with their namesake from Maharashtra, including language, rituals, and even architectural styles. 

Their history connects them to the now peaceful region where a landmark memorial, the Kala Aam, commemorates the loss of Maratha commander Sadashiv Rao Bhau.  While Neeraj Chopra’s connection to the community has been debated, the story of the Rod Marathas exemplifies how historical events can lead to the creation of new communities in unexpected locations.

The article discusses the geopolitical tensions surrounding Bangladesh, particularly concerning the recent political upheaval and China's growing influence.  

After the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who maintained a balanced relationship with both India and China, there is concern about Bangladesh becoming more aligned with China. China has invested heavily in Bangladesh's infrastructure and military, supplying advanced weapons systems and building strategic facilities. This has raised concerns in India, especially as Baladiganag, located near Bangladesh, had close ties with China and could potentially  threaten India's security.

The US has also been eyeing Bangladesh for potential military bases, but its efforts were met with resistance from Hasina. 

  The article concludes by urging India to remain proactive in its engagement with Bangladesh, strengthening bilateral ties, and promoting regional cooperation to counter China's growing influence in the Bay of Bengal region.

This article examines the geopolitical implications of the US and Russia supplying arms to opposing sides in the Middle East. The US strongly backs Israel with substantial military aid, including advanced weaponry like F-35 fighter jets and missile defence systems, aiming to counter Iran's influence and secure its ally's security. Conversely, Russia arms countries opposed to US interests, like Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah, providing sophisticated weaponry such as the S-400 air defence system. This arms race increases regional instability and risks escalating conflicts, as demonstrated by the perpetual tension between Israel and Iran.

The article argues that this rivalry reflects a broader global power struggle between the US and Russia, extending beyond the Middle East. This competition intensifies the danger of misunderstanding and escalation, raising concerns for global peace and stability.  It concludes by emphasizing the need for the international community to promote dialogue and cooperation to prevent further destabilization.

The resignation of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, following widespread protests, creates uncertainty for Indo-Bangla relations.  Historically close, the countries have enjoyed cooperation in various sectors, including trade, security, and regional connectivity.  However, the emergence of a potentially US-leaning government necessitates careful navigation by India. 

Ensuring the continuity of economic partnerships, security cooperation, and regional connectivity projects will be crucial. India must engage proactively with the new government, emphasizing stability and mutual interests while encouraging a balanced foreign policy for Bangladesh. The future of the relationship hinges on navigating this transition with foresight and a shared vision for regional prosperity.

Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, carrying astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore, experienced multiple delays and technical issues since its launch in June.  Initially intended for a week-long mission to the International Space Station (ISS), the return date has been pushed back multiple times due to helium leaks and software glitches.

The article critiques the  "International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples" (IDWIP), arguing that its celebration in India is inappropriate and carries a hidden agenda.  

The author contends that the date, August 9,  is insensitive as it marks a historical event of genocide against indigenous peoples by European powers. While acknowledging the plight of indigenous populations globally, the author emphasizes that India's own history doesn't align with the Western narrative of indigenous people as solely victims.  

The article suggests celebrating the contributions of prominent tribal figures in India's history instead. It concludes by highlighting that IDWIP represents Western atonement for past atrocities, while "Janjatiya Gaurav Divas" (Tribal Pride Day) in India celebrates the indigenous spirit inherent in all Indians.

Vietnam and the Philippines recently conducted their first joint coast guard exercises in Manila Bay, a significant move against growing Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea. The drills, which included search and rescue, fire control, and friendly sports competitions, highlight the two nations'  shared concerns over Beijing's expansionist ambitions in the region. 

Despite their own overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea, both Vietnam and the Philippines are increasingly cooperating to counter Chinese actions. This comes after a recent violent confrontation between Chinese and Philippine coast guards in the Philippine-controlled waters of Second Thomas Shoal. 


The growing alignment between Vietnam, the Philippines, and the United States, through initiatives like the “Squad” security arrangement, has heightened tensions with China, which views these actions as a direct challenge to its regional influence.

Sheikh Hasina's departure from Bangladesh following her resignation has left the Awami League party in a precarious situation, raising questions about its future.  Hissitianing echoes previous dynastic monarch removals  Hasina's sudden exit, after a resounding election victory just eight months prior, contrasts sharply with her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, who was assassinated during a coup.  

The Bangladesh Army facilitated Hasina's escape, opting for a less disruptive transition compared to a full-fledged coup. This move appears to align with the student-led movement demanding democracy and free elections, reminiscent of the 1990 downfall of General H.M. Ershad.

However, Hasina's leadership has been criticized for its autocratic tendencies and failure to secure the Awami League's future. Her ouster is likely to empower forces opposed to cultural syncretism and India, potentially impacting the delicate Indo-Bangladesh relationship.

Bangladesh's political history has been turbulent, marked by coups, violence, and political instability. The recent ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina by mass student protests has raised concerns about an indefinite civil war. 

Deep-seated mistrust between the two major political parties, the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, fuels the conflict. The military's involvement in politics is another significant factor, with generals frequently seizing power.  The rise of student power, coupled with increasing Islamic radicalization, adds to the complexity.  Foreign powers, such as Pakistan, may also exploit the situation to their advantage.

With an aging and ailing Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus leading the interim government, there are doubts about his ability to manage the prevailing chaos. Bangladesh faces a period of internal upheaval with potentially serious consequences for neighboring India.

A series of Israeli assassinations targeting Iranian proxy commanders in Lebanon, Syria, and potentially Qatar has heightened tensions in the Middle East. While Israel maintains silence, Iran accuses Israel's Mossad of being behind the killings, viewing it as a serious breach of security and a test to its regional influence.  

These attacks, believed to be part of a more calculated strategy by Israel, have ramifications for both Israelis and Iranians. Israel  experiences a boost in military morale and a political lifeline for Netanyahu, but faces potential Iranian retaliation. Iran, facing embarrassment and pressure to respond, is evaluating its options, including limited strikes, covert operations, or even terrorism.

The international community, particularly the US, is engaged in a delicate balancing act, providing Israel with military support while trying to contain the situation and prevent further escalation.

The article discusses  the parallels between Sikh extremism and Islamic extremism, drawing comparisons to the Air India 1985 bombing and the rise of Al Qaeda. 

The author argues that, similar to how Islamist extremists exploited  religious organizations and charities for their agenda, pro-Khalistan activists are hijacking peaceful Sikh communities.

It concludes that unlike  the US's post-9/11 understanding of Islamist extremism,  Sikh extremism remains largely unnoticed, urging a reevaluation of this growing threat and a focus on supporting authentic Sikh communities.

The article discusses the escalating tensions in the Middle East following a series of assassinations targeting key figures in Iran-supported groups.  These incidents, including the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, have led to a heightened risk of a regional war. 

Iran, vowing revenge, possesses a formidable arsenal, including ballistic missiles, drones, and proxies like Hezbollah and the Houthis. 

Hezbollah has a vast cache of rockets and anti-tank missiles, while the Houthis specialize in  ballistic and cruise missiles, and drones. 

Hamas, while lacking conventional forces, relies on guerrilla tactics and a smaller arsenal of rockets. Israel, meanwhile, is relying on its robust air defenses to counter potential attacks. The situation remains precarious, with the possibility of a full-blown regional conflict looming large.

### [Bangladesh is in the throes of Islamist pogrom against minority Hindus, and our liberals are busy obfuscating reality](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-is-in-the-throes-of-islamist-pogrom-against-minority-hindus-and-our-liberals-are-busy-obfuscating-reality-13802267.html)

The student-led movement in Bangladesh, which led to the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has descended into violence and persecution of the Hindu minority. Extremist Islamist groups, such as Jamaat-e-Islami, have capitalized on the chaos, targeting Hindu homes, businesses, and temples.  

Videos and testimonies depict horrific scenes of violence, including lynchings and desecration of religious sites. Despite these alarming reports, some Indian liberals are downplaying the situation, labeling it as "exaggerated" or an "attempt by Hindu right-wing" to create a narrative. 

The present crisis has historical roots, as Hindus were historically targeted during the Bangladesh liberation war, with widespread violence and sexual attacks documented. Though the ouster of Hasina brought initial celebrations, the subsequent violence and targeting of Hindus reveals a deeper, more sinister agenda driven by Islamist extremists who have seized the opportunity to unleash their hatred and create a climate of fear for the Hindu community.  

This recent violence against Hindus in Bangladesh raises serious concerns about the safety and security of the minority population and highlights the urgent need for international intervention to protect their rights.

Kamala Harris selected Tim Walz as her running mate after evaluating several potential candidates. Walz, a two-term Minnesota governor and former congressman, offers experience, political savvy, and a center-of-the-road approach that contrasts with Harris's progressive stance. His selection aims to balance the ticket both geographically and ideologically, attracting white working-class voters and providing counterpoint to Donald Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance. Walz's military service and Midwestern demeanor are seen as assets, while potential vulnerabilities regarding his record on issues like immigration and law enforcement may be exploited by the Republican campaign.

### [Bangladesh crisis: A play of invisible Chinese hand?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-crisis-a-play-of-invisible-chinese-hand-13802059.html)

The article argues that China may be orchestrating a coup in Bangladesh against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina due to her stance against Islamic extremism and her pro-India leanings. 

The author cites China's increasing engagement with Islamic extremist groups globally, including Pakistan-sponsored terrorists, Hamas, and the Taliban, as evidence of its shifting strategy. This engagement, he suggests, is fueled by an aim to counter India and secure geopolitical advantage, potentially leading to instability in the region.  

The article concludes that China's alliance with Islamic extremist groups could backfire, as these groups often pursue their own interests regardless of their backers.

India is deeply intertwined with Bangladesh's internal affairs due to their shared border, religious connections, and water resources. India's support for Sheikh Hasina's leadership, despite growing international pressure and domestic challenges, arose from concerns about cross-border infiltration and the potential for instability.  The recent elections, marred by opposition boycotts and allegations of authoritarianism, have raised questions about India's approach. The article suggests potential avenues India could have explored, such as encouraging a more inclusive political landscape in Bangladesh. It also draws parallels with the 1975 political turmoil in India under Indira Gandhi, highlighting the potential for regional instability to have repercussions for India.

### [From hope to despair: Testing time for democracy in Bangladesh](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/from-hope-to-despair-testing-time-for-democracy-in-bangladesh-13801957.html)

Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, resigned and fled to India amidst violent student protests. Initially sparked by quota demands in government jobs, the protests escalated, with the backing of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh and its student wing, Islami Chhatra Shibir. These groups have a history of anti-Awami League sentiments and have been implicated in war crimes during Bangladesh's liberation in 1971.  

The violence resulted in numerous deaths, attacks on Hindu communities, and damage to public and private property.  The Bangladeshi Army intervened, establishing an interim government and raising concerns about a potential return to military rule.  The resurfacing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), with the release of jailed leader Khaleda Zia, further complicates the political landscape, creating a potential power struggle between the Army and Jamaat-BNP. 

The situation paints a worrying picture for Bangladesh's future, with democratic processes seemingly compromised and the rise of extremist elements posing a grave threat to stability.

A recent upheaval in Bangladesh has resulted in the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Protests, initially sparked by a court ruling on quotas for the offspring of freedom fighters, escalated into widespread violence and demonstrations demanding Hasina's removal. 

Factors contributing to the unrest include allegations of government corruption, suppression of media freedom, enforced disappearances, and a controversial Digital Security Act.  The army, observing growing public discontent and after a plea from retired officers, intervened to ensure stability, ultimately giving Hasina an ultimatum to resign. 

The situation has attracted international attention, with the US and EU expressing their positions on the developments.  India faces potential implications from the instability,  including a possible influx of refugees and the need to navigate its relationships with various Bangladeshi political forces.

The article discusses the United States' removal of Sheikh Hasina as Prime Minister of Bangladesh, arguing this decision plays into the hands of Pakistan and China.  The author criticizes the US's hypocritical stance on democracy, citing similar interference in the past.

The removal of Hasina, who the author believes provided stability and protected minorities, is framed as a CIA-led "revolution" that benefits chaotic outcomes and challenges India's security. 

The author sees the US move as a miscalculation, ultimately strengthening China's influence in the region and warns of potential similar machinations against India.

### [India in a hostile neighbourhood: Way ahead for New Delhi](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/india-in-a-hostile-neighbourhood-way-ahead-for-new-delhi-13801446.html)

The fall of Sheikh Hasina's government in Bangladesh raises concerns about India's security. The opposition groups, Jamaat-e-Islami and Bangladesh National Party (BNP), are anti-secular and potentially aligned with Pakistan and possibly the US Deep State. These groups aim to establish an Islamic identity in Bangladesh, contrasting with its secular foundation.  

The US involvement, while seemingly promoting "democracy," could be driven by strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific region, aiming to counter China and exert pressure on India.


India faces the prospect of hostile neighbours on all sides. To counteract this, it should strengthen ties with Southeast Asia,  Indo-Pacific powers, and the Middle East, leveraging its historical strengths in trade, military power, and cultural influence to secure its position and promote stability in the region.

### [Why Bangladesh crisis demands a pragmatic approach from Mamata Banerjee](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-bangladesh-crisis-demands-a-pragmatic-approach-from-mamata-banerjee-13801431.html)

The recent turmoil in Bangladesh has created a potential refugee crisis in West Bengal, India.  West Bengal, with its long history of hosting refugees, faces significant demographic, economic, and social challenges. The influx could strain public services, exacerbate unemployment, and potentially heighten religious tensions.  While Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's stance of welcoming refugees is commendable, it is argued that this approach is flawed and potentially risky. Critics contend that it ignores the potential strain on resources and security, and could lead to unintended consequences.

A more balanced approach, they suggest, requires careful planning, collaboration with the central government and international organizations, and measures to ensure the well-being of both refugees and the local population.

Political unrest in Bangladesh culminated in the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Protests, initially sparked by a High Court decision reinstating a quota system for government jobs, escalated into a nationwide crisis exposing economic instability, corruption, and a pattern of government crackdowns. 

The unrest has raised concerns in India, as Hasina's government was considered a close ally. Her departure presents an opportunity for China, which has faced a strained relationship with Bangladeshi leadership. While the unrest appears to have organic roots, suspicions remain about potential foreign influence, particularly from China, seeking to advance its strategic interests in the region.  India now requires a cautious approach to navigate this shift in Bangladesh's political landscape and develop a contingency plan.

The article discusses a letter signed by prominent Indian citizens urging the government to halt arms exports to Israel due to the ongoing conflict with Hamas. The author argues that this move would be detrimental to India's burgeoning defense manufacturing sector, which has seen significant growth in recent years.  

India's collaboration with Israel in defense technology is highlighted as a valuable asset in bolstering India's military capabilities. The author criticizes the signatories of the letter for selectively applying moral and humanitarian concerns while neglecting similar issues in other conflicts, particularly those involving China and Pakistan.  She concludes that prioritizing national interest and commercial partnerships is crucial for India's defense aspirations.

Darrin McMahon's book "Equality" explores the complex and multifaceted nature of equality throughout history.  

While universally desired, the concept of equality has been subject to reinterpretation and exclusion across diverse cultures, religions, and political ideologies. From ancient societies to modern thought, equality has been both a guiding principle and a tool of differentiation. 

McMahon highlights the inherent tension between the human capacity for cooperation and the tendency towards hierarchy and power.  He argues that achieving and sustaining equality requires constant vigilance against regressive systems of inequality.

The article discusses India's role within the Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) and its evolving relationship with China. 

Recent speculation regarding a potential China-India détente, fueled by high-level diplomatic meetings, has led to questions about India's commitment to Quad. The article argues that despite India's economic considerations regarding China, such as  concerns over a trade deficit and potential for increased Chinese FDI, its geopolitical strategy remains focused on balancing China's influence.

India's approach to Quad is described as broader than a mere security framework, encompassing technological collaboration, supply chain resilience, and humanitatian assistance.  The article emphasizes India's strengthening security ties with Southeast Asian nations to counter China's assertiveness in the South China Sea, citing specific examples like arms deals with Vietnam, joint exercises with the Philippines, and increased engagement with Indonesia and other ASEAN members.

Ultimately, the article argues that India's strategy in the Indo-Pacific is multi-faceted, aiming to deter Chinese aggression through a combination of bilateral, plurilateral, and multilateral engagements. While acknowledging Quad's evolving role, the author emphasizes that India maintains its independence and avoids becoming entangled in a rigid security alliance.

The assassination of Ismail Haniyeh poses a significant challenge for Iran.  The regime feels pressured to respond to protect its stability and influence in the region.  However, Iran is constrained by economic difficulties and the risk of a full-scale war with Israel and potentially the US.  A direct confrontation would be too costly, particularly given the threat to Iran's nuclear program.

Instead, Iran is likely to increase support for its proxies in Lebanon and other areas through actions like missile strikes.  The situation remains tense, with miscalculations by either Iran or Israel potentially escalating the conflict.

The article argues that Tibet, with its history of sovereignty stretching back to the 7th century, has been unjustly occupied by China since 1950-51.  It contends that China's expansionist policies threaten India's security and points to recent US actions supporting Tibetan autonomy as aligning with India's interests.  
The author proposes several steps India should take, including  establishing diplomatic relations with the Tibetan government-in-exile, supporting other oppressed groups within China, and pushing for international recognition of Tibet's sovereignty.  They maintain that supporting Tibet is essential for securing India's national interest.

Political instability, labeled as "chienlit" by Charles de Gaulle, has gripped France as President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the National Assembly and called for snap elections shortly before the 2024 Summer Olympics. 

The inconclusive elections, resulting in a fragmented political landscape, have added to the already tense situation. 

Despite this internal turmoil, the Olympics proceeded, witnessing both praise for its innovative opening ceremony featuring female icons, and criticism for a controversial tableau portraying Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last Supper" with drag queens. 

Amidst the political maneuvering of Macron seeking a consensual Prime Minister, the Games continue, serving as a platform for international unity despite the backdrop of national uncertainty.

This article explores the complex history and present-day challenges of Mewat, a region in northwestern India encompassing parts of Haryana and Rajasthan.  

Historically, the Meos, the region's inhabitants, were known for banditry and resistance to the Delhi Sultanate.  After forced conversion to Islam by Sultan Balban, the Meos continued to struggle with lawlessness despite a visible Islamic presence in the region.

The article examines how the region's heritage blends both Islamic and Hindu influences, evident in architectural styles and local narratives. Today, Mewat faces socio-economic problems, including low literacy rates, poverty, and high crime, which is attributed, in part, to the Tablighi Jamaat's influence.

Despite these challenges, the author notes a glimmer of hope, pointing to a recent religious procession in Nuh that was met with peaceful greetings, suggesting a potential for progress and unity in the future.

It highlights the devastating human and economic costs of the conflict and criticizes the West's military aid to Ukraine, arguing that it prolongs the war. 

The author also reveals a potential peace deal that could have ended the conflict within 100 days but was allegedly scuttled by the US and UK. He questions the purpose of Modi's visit, given India’s historical ties with Russia and Ukraine’s criticism of India's stance on the war.  

The article concludes by expressing doubt about the visit yielding concrete results and urging readers to observe the unfolding events.

The World Development Report 2024 highlights the "middle-income trap," where countries face stunted growth after reaching a certain level of income.  The report warns that 108 middle-income countries, including India, face unique challenges in escaping this trap.  It suggests a "3i" strategy: investments, infusion of technology, and innovation. While India might benefit from the initial "2i"s, it's urged to prioritize innovation and research & development, leveraging its  demographic dividend and human capital.  Addressing socio-economic inequalities is crucial to ensure inclusive growth and achieve the goal of "Vikisit Bharat" by 2047.

This article analyzes the evolution of Israeli warfare strategies since its founding. It highlights Israel's early victories in conflicts against Arab nations, attributing them to strategic military prowess. However, the author argues that Israel's post-1973 confrontations with Iranian proxies, particularly Hezbollah and Hamas, marked a shift towards a "forever in war" mentality characterized by terrorism.

The author asserts that the IDF's past successes are no longer translating into decisive victories, exemplified by the current conflict. This, coupled with Israel's exclusive reliance on military force over fostering non-partisan relations within opposing societies, has perpetuated the conflict. The author contrasts this with India's approach to hybrid warfare, emphasizing a more pragmatic and conflict-ending strategy.

The article examines Pakistan's repeated history of military misadventures against India, focusing on the Kargil War of 1999. It argues that this pattern stems from Pakistani leaders seeking to bolster their political standing through appeals to national pride and a perception of Indian threat. 

The author highlights how Pakistani leaders, including Ayub Khan, Bhutto, Yahya Khan, and Musharraf, capitalized on anti-India sentiment to justify wars, ultimately leading to their downfall. The Kargil War, in particular, is depicted as a strategic miscalculation that underscored Pakistan's conventional military weakness against India.  The author concludes by stating that each war waged by a Pakistani premier against India has resulted in their political demise.

India faces a significant youth unemployment crisis, with estimates varying widely due to data limitations. While the government highlights job creation, surveys by organizations like CMIE paint a contrasting picture, revealing high unemployment rates, particularly among educated youth. Young workers often find themselves in the informal sector with poor-quality jobs, facing challenges like low wages and inadequate working conditions. 

Addressing this issue requires coordinated efforts. The government should consolidate existing skill development and employment schemes under a single umbrella at the district level, providing a comprehensive support system for youth. Initiatives like the Youth Guarantee program implemented in the EU serve as successful models for empowering youth through education, training, and employment opportunities.

India's "Neighbourhood First" policy faces challenges due to China's growing influence in the Indian Ocean region. 

China's naval presence, infrastructure projects like the Belt and Road Initiative, and economic dependencies are shaping the region in a way that could undermine India's interests. While India has focused on building trust and capacity-building with its maritime neighbors, it needs to move faster and be more effective in its approach. China's methods, while arguably more efficient, often involve debt-trap diplomacy and long-term dependencies.  India's need to rewrite "The Hare and the Tortoise" fable,  means that it must act more decisively and deliver tangible results to counter China's growing influence.

Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas's political bureau, was killed in a strike in Iran. This follows a pattern of Israeli targeted killings of Hamas leaders, including military figures like Mohammed Deif and Marwan Issa.  

Despite the ongoing Israeli assassinations, Hamas has demonstrated resilience, replenishing its leadership with successors. Khaled Mashal, a former Hamas leader, is considered a likely candidate to replace Haniyeh.

Hamas's structure, characterized by a "beehive" like leadership, enables it to withstand the loss of key figures. Even with the elimination of top leaders, new individuals step in, perpetuating the organization's operations and goals.

Israel is employing a strategy of total confrontation against its enemies, exemplified by recent targeted assassinations of high-ranking Hezbollah and Hamas officials. 

These precision strikes demonstrate Israel's ability to strike anywhere, sending a clear message of deterrence. With Hamas momentarily weakened, Israel is focusing on Hezbollah, considering a land invasion to cripple its military capability. This aggressive posture, driven by both security concerns and Netanyahu's political interests, aims to solidify his power base. However, this strategy risks escalating the conflict, particularly if provoked by Iran,  leading to a wider and more devastating war. Israel's aggressive actions highlight the need for a balanced approach that combines military strength with strategic foresight to avoid unintended consequences.

Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas's political bureau, was assassinated in Tehran. While Israel celebrated the killing, Hamas vowed revenge and declared open war to liberate Jerusalem. Haniyeh was a key negotiator in ceasefire talks with Israel, and his death is seen as a setback for the fragile peace efforts. 

Hamas is expected to retaliate, potentially leading to further escalation in the already tense region.  International concern surrounds the potential for a larger conflict, which could have global ramifications. The assassination raises questions about Israel's broader strategy, and its impact on the future of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains unclear.

The US, Japan, and South Korea have formalized their trilateral security cooperation with a historic agreement. This comes amidst growing concerns regarding North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the rising tensions with China, and the ever-present security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region. The agreement, known as the Trilateral Security Cooperation Framework (TSCF), aims to enhance cooperation in areas such as intelligence sharing, joint exercises, and defense technology exchange. This move signifies a deepening of ties between the three countries, seeking to  bolster their collective security and deter aggression from North Korea and China.  

The agreement follows several high-level summits and the resumption of defense exchanges between Japan and South Korea, overcoming past historical tensions. The US sees this strengthened trilateral relationship as crucial to its strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific, prompting  the realignment of its military forces in Japan to better address regional challenges.  The pact also highlights a shared concern about China's assertiveness in the region, as the three nations reiterate their opposition to any unilateral attempts to change the status quo.

Recent diplomatic exchanges between India and China highlight the ongoing border dispute and differing views on how to resolve it. Despite Chinese assurances of progress, India remains vigilant due to recent actions like the construction of a bridge near the Line of Actual Control (LAC).  

China's historical approach to border settlements, prioritizing its strategic and economic interests, coupled with its evolving security doctrines, suggests a complex calculation in its dealings with India.  China views India's growing ties with the US as a potential threat, and fears India could exploit the situation to advance its own territorial claims. Additionally, a potential conflict in the East and South China Seas could see India playing a crucial role, potentially blocking China's sea lines of communication. 

India must continue its firm stance and remain vigilant against Chinese misadventures, ensuring that any perceived progress does not become a new status quo.

### [Why US policies fail to resonate with Arab public opinion](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-us-policies-fail-to-resonate-with-arab-public-opinion-13799262.html)

The article analyzes the declining American influence in West Asia, citing growing anti-US sentiment fueled by the US's unwavering support for Israel and perceived failure to address regional grievances. Despite significant financial and military aid, the US struggles to gain popular support due to interventions in Iraq and Libya, which fueled mistrust. 

The article argues that the US has been unable to define clear strategic objectives and has been slow to adapt to shifting power dynamics, allowing Iran to gain influence.  Furthermore, US policies are often perceived as hypocritical and inconsistent, particularly regarding Israel and human rights, creating fertile ground for anti-US propaganda.

The author concludes by noting that this creates an opportunity for other powers like China to increase their diplomatic and economic engagement in the region, posing a significant challenge to the US's traditional dominance.

### [Why India needs to balance security concerns with neighbours’ sovereign considerations](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-india-needs-to-balance-security-concerns-with-neighbours-sovereign-considerations-13798861.html)

This article examines India's approach to its neighborhood, particularly concerning China. It argues that India often expects its neighbors to prioritize its security concerns, even when those concerns don't directly affect the neighbors. 

The article cites examples like the "India Out" campaign in the Maldives and the handling of the Kachchatheevu issue with Sri Lanka, where India's actions seemed to dictate the neighbor's responses. It criticizes India's lack of transparency and consultation with its neighbors regarding security pacts with extra-regional powers like the US and its inconsistent diplomacy with countries like Pakistan and China.

The author suggests that India needs to move towards a more inclusive approach, involving its neighbors in discussions and respecting their strategic autonomy. This approach could involve strengthening the Colombo Security Conclave as a forum for building trust and addressing shared security concerns in the Indian Ocean region.

India's relationship with Myanmar's military junta is a complex balancing act driven by strategic necessity. Despite the junta's waning legitimacy and human rights abuses, India maintains support due to the crucial role Myanmar plays in regional stability, counter-terrorism efforts, and countering Chinese influence. The porous border fuels security concerns, including narcotics trafficking and the rise of Chinese-backed militias, necessitating continued engagement with the junta on these issues. While India aims to promote a democratic transition in the long term, the immediate priority is to manage the volatile situation and protect national interests.

Prime Minister Modi's potential visit to Ukraine aims to  strengthen India's stance on diplomacy and dialogue to resolve the conflict.  

While India has maintained close ties with Russia, it has also expressed concern over civilian casualties and advocated for peace.  Modi's planned visit could counter negative perceptions stemming from his recent Moscow trip and demonstrate India's commitment to a peaceful resolution. 

Russia might welcome the initiative as a way to bring Ukraine down to a negotiating position, while the US could view it as a diplomatic win for its own objectives in the region. India's involvement could also help counter China's growing influence in mediating the conflict.

Despite endorsements from top Democrats like Barack Obama and key figures like Nancy Pelosi, Joe Biden's performance in the recent debate and declining public support led him to withdraw from the presidential race. 

Facing pressure from donors, party members, and polls showing him trailing Donald Trump, Biden ultimately chose to step down.  He then shockingly endorsed Kamala Harris, indicating it was a pre-planned move and a form of "revenge" on some Democrats who advocated for his removal.  

Although the Democratic party favoured a different nomination process, Biden's exit left them with minimal options. The article suggests he ensured Harris, his initial VP pick, became the nominee despite her lagging behind potential alternatives in polls.

The article argues that India's economic growth, while impressive, hasn't adequately benefited its people, particularly those at the bottom of the economic pyramid. 

The author believes that prioritizing agriculture is crucial for inclusive growth.  Agriculture, despite employing a large portion of the workforce, has seen declining growth and productivity. The article recommends substantial investment in technology, infrastructure, and research & development to revitalize the sector.  

It also calls for a revised approach to supporting farmers, moving beyond subsidies to measures like a negotiated Minimum Support Price (MSP) to ensure basic income and incentivize diversification. The author concludes by urging policymakers to focus on foundational reforms in agriculture, healthcare, and education to uplift the majority of the population.

A potential second Trump term could significantly impact India-US relations across various sectors. 

Economically, while "America First" policies might pose a threat to Indian exports, they could also lead to increased investment in India as American companies seek alternatives to China. 

Migration, however, is likely to face challenges due to potential tightening of visa programmes, affecting Indian IT professionals, students, and families.

On the military front, an expected continuation of strong defense cooperation could bolster India's capabilities and strategic positioning in the Indo-Pacific. 

Shared concerns regarding China's growing influence may solidify the strategic partnership between India and the US, potentially strengthening alliances like the Quad. 
 
Overall, a Trump 2.0 presidency presents both opportunities and risks for India, requiring careful diplomatic navigation by the Indian government.

This article argues that the US government, through its embassies in India, is engaging in covert operations to influence Indian domestic politics.

The author points to a series of events, including a workshop hosted by the US embassy on combating disinformation, which was associated with groups known for their partisan leanings and perceived connections to American foundations with a history of supporting regime change efforts. 

The author suggests that these actions, while presented as efforts to promote democracy and human rights, are actually attempts to undermine the Indian government's ideological stance and strengthen opposition voices. He cites examples of US pressure on social media companies to censor certain viewpoints and alleged US funding of organizations engaged in biased information dissemination.  The article concludes that such actions erode trust in the US-India strategic partnership.

China recently brokered a peace agreement between various Palestinian factions, including Hamas and Fatah, in Beijing. This agreement, hailed as a diplomatic achievement by Chinese media,  calls for a unified Palestinian government once the war in Gaza ends.

China is touting this agreement, along with other recent diplomatic efforts, as proof of its emerging role as a global peacemaker. However, critics argue that this claim is premature and hypocritical. They point to the lack of real progress in the Saudi-Iran rapprochement,  and question China's support for terrorist groups, such as Hamas. 


Furthermore, past Palestinian unity agreements have failed, and this pact is viewed with skepticism by some experts. The author contends that China's actions highlight a dangerous hypocrisy, and call for a more critical examination of Beijing's motivations.

Research by the Wildlife Institute of India has revealed a unique migratory pattern of house sparrows in the Uttarakhand Himalayas.  These sparrows follow the seasonal movements of local villagers, abandoning high-altitude villages in winter when people descend to warmer areas and returning with them in the summer.  

This suggests a strong bond between the sparrows and humans in these communities. The study has also found that high-altitude house sparrows are larger in size compared to their counterparts at lower elevations, an adaptation to the colder climate.  The findings contribute to our understanding of the adaptation strategies and interdependence of wildlife with human populations in unique environments.

The article discusses the implications of the US "Promote a Resolution to the Tibet-China Dispute Act" signed into law. 

The author analyzes the historical context surrounding Tibet's loss of independence, highlighting failures of international support and the influence of the "Great Game" dynamics. The law's affirmation of Tibetans' right to self-determination and its rejection of China's historical claims to Tibet are noted.

However, the author also expresses skepticism about its effectiveness due to the longstanding "One-China Policy" and the tense US-China relations.  The article emphasizes the importance of India as a third polarity in negotiations, considering its historical border disputes with China and its continued presence as Tibet's neighbor. 


It also mentions the Chinese government's crackdown on Tibetan culture, citing the recent closure of a prominent vocational school in Qinghai province as an example.  Ultimately, the author urges Tibetans to include India in any future negotiations,  
advocating for a multi-polar approach to the dispute.

The article examines the contrasting approaches of China and the US to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.  While both nations claim support for a two-state solution, China has engaged actively with Palestinian factions, including Hamas and Fatah, aiming for a unified approach under the PLO. 

This stance contrasts with the US, which remains aligned with Israel, despite growing criticism of its actions in Gaza. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, in a recent address to the US Congress, emphasized the threat posed by Iran and its proxies, including Hamas, while also reiterating Israel's commitment to its security.

The author highlights the challenges in achieving a lasting solution, with deep divisions within Palestinian groups and intractable positions on both sides. Beijing's efforts to foster dialogue and a unified Palestinian front may hold significant influence in shaping future outcomes.

The article discusses Pakistan's continued use of terrorism against India, despite facing its own internal security challenges. Prime Minister Modi's address in Drass, where he warned Pakistan against its terror tactics, is highlighted. 

Pakistan's current economic crisis hasn't deterred its reliance on terrorism, which is evident in attacks on civilians and security forces within Pakistan,  attributed to groups like Jaish Fursan e Muhammad and the Tehreek-e-Taliban-e-Pakistan (TTP).  

The Pakistani army, through its spokesperson, emphasizes its ongoing efforts to combat terrorism with the "Azm-e-Istehkam" campaign. However, the army's comments also reveal a sense of frustration with the state of affairs, pointing to the role of  "digital terrorists" in undermining the country and accusing India of seeking to exploit Pakistan's vulnerabilities.  

The author, a former Indian diplomat, stresses Pakistan's need to normalize relations with India for its own progress and security, concluding that perpetual enmity with India will only lead to further struggles.

China's campaign of Sinification, aimed at assimilating ethnic minorities into Han Chinese culture, is expanding beyond Xinjiang. Hui Muslims in Yuxi, a significant Muslim minority in mainland China, are facing increased restrictions on religious practices, surveillance, and forced cultural erasure under the guise of separating religion from education. Similar policies implemented in Xinjiang, including mass internment in "re-education camps" and intrusive surveillance, have resulted in the detention of over a million Uyghurs and other Muslim minorities.

While China deflects criticism by leveraging its economic power, the international community remains largely silent on the escalating human rights violations.  The author argues that China's repressive measures only fuel separatism and extremism, calling for a more inclusive and conciliatory approach that respects cultural and religious freedoms and addresses underlying grievances.

### [The spillover impact of student protests in Bangladesh and implications for India](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/the-spillover-impact-of-student-protests-in-bangladesh-and-implications-for-india-13797236.html)

Student-led protests in Bangladesh, sparked by the reinstatement of a controversial quota system for government jobs, pose a significant challenge to the ruling Awami League government. The protests, which have resulted in dozens of deaths and injuries, have led to a nationwide shutdown, internet restrictions, and detentions of protesters, including opposition leaders.  The government's attempt to label protesters as traitors has further escalated tensions.  

The protests have impacted trade between Bangladesh and India, prompted an advisory for Indian nationals, and raised concerns about the spillover effect of the unrest. Critics argue that the quota system is discriminatory and violates constitutional principles of equality, while the government maintains its support for the measure. As China expands its influence in Bangladesh, these internal challenges add to concerns about regional stability and impact diplomatic relations.

### [25 years of Kargil: Lessons on high altitude aerial combat against a bigger enemy this time](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/25-years-of-kargil-lessons-on-high-altitude-aerial-combat-against-a-bigger-enemy-this-time-13797181.html)

The Kargil War, a conflict between India and Pakistan in 1999, serves as a crucial lesson for India in its ongoing standoff with China. Pakistan's surprise infiltration tactic in Kargil highlights the importance of robust intelligence gathering and border surveillance, lessons that remain relevant in the context of the current tensions with China along the Line of Actual Control (LAC).

The article emphasizes the need for India to bolster its airpower capabilities.  Prioritizing the induction of modern fighter aircraft, Airborne Early Warning and Control (AEW&C) systems, and Flight Refuelling Aircraft (FRA) is crucial.  

Investing in a larger and more capable UAV fleet, along with strengthening air defenses with missile systems like BrahMos and Akash, is also imperative. 

The article underscores the significance of high-altitude training and infrastructure development to meet the unique challenges of fighting a war in the mountainous terrain of the Himalayas. It concludes by stressing the need for swift political action to address the urgent requirement of modernizing India's Air Force to counter the growing military might of China.

### [Ramification | Bangladesh’s quota protests: A test for Sheikh Hasina’s leadership](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ramification-bangladeshs-quota-protests-a-test-for-sheikh-hasinas-leadership-13797034.html)

Protests in Bangladesh erupted over the reinstatement of a quota system reserving government jobs for certain groups, including descendants of 1971 war heroes. While the Supreme Court suspended the high court's order, the situation escalated into violence, claiming over 150 lives and prompting internet suspension, curfews, and deployment of security forces. 

The protests, fueled by the government's use of the derogatory term "Razakar" to refer to the demonstrators, have been exploited by the Opposition to undermine the ruling Awami League's legitimacy.  The unrest has  raised concerns about the potential resurgence of Jamaat-e-Islami, a proscribed group with ties to international jihadi networks.  
 
External pressure from the US, coupled with the BNP's anti-India rhetoric, further complicates the situation.   India views the stability of the Sheikh Hasina-led government as crucial for its own security and Act East policy, fearing the rise of anti-India forces and instability in the region should the government fall.

### [Great power politics: BRI and IMEEC at the crossroads of global influence](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/great-power-politics-bri-and-imeec-at-the-crossroads-of-global-influence-13797030.html)

The article analyzes the rivalry between China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the US-led India, Middle East, Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC).  

China's economic rise and its ambition to reshape the global order through BRI are seen as a challenge to US hegemony. The US, in response, is seeking to counter BRI through IMEEC, forming alliances within a bipolar power structure.  

While both initiatives aim to enhance connectivity and economic growth, the article suggests IMEEC has a higher chance of success due to the US's democratic values, transparency, and global trust. BRI, on the other hand, has faced criticism regarding debt-trap diplomacy and lack of transparency. India, wary of both US and Chinese approaches, advocates for a more pluralistic and inclusive world order.

### [India’s climate tightrope: Green growth for Viksit Bharat](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/indias-climate-tightrope-green-growth-for-viksit-bharat-13796904.html)

India's approach to climate change prioritizes balancing economic growth with environmental sustainability, diverging from a global focus solely on temperature targets.  

The country's per capita emissions are significantly lower than the global average, driven by a commitment to "Viksit Bharat" (developed India) by 2047 and net-zero emissions by 2070. While India acknowledges the importance of renewable energy and has made significant strides, it also recognizes the need for a diversified energy mix, including nuclear power.  

India's National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC) outlines strategies for sustainable development across various sectors, with achievements already exceeding initial goals. The government also emphasizes adaptation measures to address climate vulnerability and promotes sustainable lifestyles rooted in traditional values.

### [Reality check: Can India do anything about American interference in politics?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/reality-check-can-india-do-anything-about-american-interference-in-politics-13796897.html)

The article discusses how the West, particularly the US, engages in cultural influence operations around the world, using programs like the Fulbright initiative and interactions with intellectuals and influencers. The author argues that India is facing a challenge in countering this soft power as it lacks comparable resources and strategies.  

While acknowledging the influence the US wields, the author also points out its vulnerabilities, such as corruption and a compromised political system. It suggests that India can leverage its global diaspora, which holds significant influence in various sectors, to push for Indian interests and counter Western influence.  

The article concludes by emphasizing the ongoing nature of this "cultural war" and the need for India to develop effective strategies to navigate it.

### [Is Iraq the missing piece in India’s corridor strategy?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/is-iraq-the-missing-piece-in-indias-corridor-strategy-13796760.html)

The article proposes Iraq as a strategic alternative to the India-Middle East Economic Corridor (IMEEC) and the Iran-based North-South corridor.  

Historical ties between India and Iraq, coupled with a stable political environment and burgeoning economic opportunities, make Iraq an attractive partner. India's existing trade with Iraq has more than doubled since 2020, driven by oil exports and projects in infrastructure and energy.  

The author argues that Iraq offers a more stable and predictable investment environment compared to Iran, which faces internal instability and lacks a robust commercial legal framework.  Expanding educational and business ties with Iraq would benefit both nations and solidify India's position in the Middle East.

### [China’s inward turn: A path to stability or stagnation?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/chinas-inward-turn-a-path-to-stability-or-stagnation-13796645.html)

China's economic narrative is shifting from outward expansion to inward focus, driven by a perceived need for national security and self-reliance. While bolstering domestic industries is a stated goal, this strategy masks significant challenges.  

China's export-driven economy faces mounting global resistance and sluggish domestic consumption, raising concerns about economic stability and social welfare. 

Corruption within the military weakens its effectiveness, despite significant investments in arms. The property market, once a growth engine, is plagued by financial distress and defaults, threatening the construction sector and overall economic health.

China's stance on international issues, including Taiwan, India, and the South China Sea, has become increasingly confrontational, while its ambitious Belt and Road Initiative faces setbacks. 


This inward turn, driven by a desire for control and stability, may ultimately hinder China's economic progress and global influence.

The article pays tribute to Captain Brijesh Thapa, one of four soldiers killed in an encounter with militants in Jammu and Kashmir.  Lt. Col. Thapa, a third-generation Army officer, was posthumously promoted to Captain.  The article highlights his bravery and sacrifice, emphasizing the ethos of the Indian Army, showcased through the stories of other martyrs like Lt. Manoj Pandey and Capt. Vikram Batra. It calls for taking concrete steps to prevent future such tragedies and send a strong message to Pakistan, advocating for plugging security loopholes and making such attacks costly and futile.

Joe Biden withdrew from the presidential race after weeks of pressure from within his party and public figures. His declining health and a poor debate performance against Donald Trump contributed to the decision.  

Despite calls for a more competitive process, Biden endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor. Harris has received significant support, including endorsements from key figures like Hillary and Bill Clinton and Nancy Pelosi. While the Democratic party is rallying behind her, some question whether she has sufficiently demonstrated leadership to challenge Trump. The absence of a competitive primary raises concerns about missing an opportunity to select the strongest candidate.

Finally, the budget emphasizes next-generation reforms by focusing on land, labour, capital, and entrepreneurship reforms, including digitizing cadastral maps, streamlining skilling services, and promoting climate finance.

India's Union Budget for FY 2024-25 emphasizes inclusive growth, balancing capital expenditure with welfare spending. While global uncertainties persist, India's economy remains strong with low and stable inflation. The budget prioritizes youth empowerment through programs focusing on employment, skilling, and education.  A significant allocation of Rs. 1.48 lakh crore will be directed towards these areas, including a five-year scheme to benefit 4.1 crore youth.  Initiatives like internship opportunities, employment-linked incentives, and skill loan schemes aim to equip young people with skills for the modern economy.  The government plans to upgrade 1,000 ITIs, and a new centrally sponsored scheme will collaborate with states and industry to skill 20 lakh youth over 5 years.

The budget prioritizes a steady, long-term growth trajectory towards a developed nation by 2047. It focuses on strengthening  foundations with enabling measures for rural development, youth skilling, and employment generation. 

Key highlights include a reduced fiscal deficit, infrastructure allocation maintained at previous levels, and targeted measures for specific sectors like agriculture and defense.  
Taxes have been subtly adjusted, impacting capital gains and property investments, while GST rates have seen reductions in certain categories.  The budget aims to attract foreign investment with a tax reduction for foreign companies and measures promoting ease of doing business.   
Overall, the budget reflects a cautious yet optimistic approach, focusing on sustainable growth and development.

The Union Budget emphasizes a shift in the government's role, prioritizing facilitation over direct financial responsibility. 

The government is less inclined to provide direct grants or investments, opting instead to incentivize, nudge, and offer guarantees. This is exemplified in its approach to states seeking infrastructure funding and in its plan to encourage private sector jobs through incentives for employers and first-time employees.  The government also proposes to guarantee loans for MSMEs and utilizes a new internship scheme, leveraging CSR funds to provide opportunities for youth without direct government expenditure. The budget reflects a "facilitate, don't assume" philosophy.

### [Eco Survey 2024: Amid high growth India’s future appears bright, but a ‘grand alliance’ to tame unemployment is required](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/eco-survey-2024-amid-high-growth-indias-future-appears-bright-but-a-grand-alliance-to-tame-unemployment-is-required-13795928.html)

The Economic Survey 2023-24, presented in February, highlights India's strong economic performance with growth rates exceeding 6% and controlled inflation. 

positive indicators include lowered trade deficit and surplus current account balance, supported by ample foreign exchange reserves. The Survey acknowledges the challenge of slower private sector capital formation despite high corporate profits and identifies a less favorable environment for foreign direct investment.

The Survey expresses concern about employment, highlighting the lack of timely and comprehensive data on job creation.  While optimistic about labor market indicators, it acknowledges challenges posed by structural shifts and the impact of the Fourth Industrial Revolution.  

Facing a complex global landscape with protectionism, geopolitical uncertainty, climate change and the rise of AI, the Survey emphasizes the need for a "grand alliance" between the central and state governments, and the private sector.  It calls for tripartite compacts to boost job creation, skill development, and empower the private sector to contribute to economic growth.

### [US Sutra | Biden withdraws from presidential race, but road remains bumpy for Democrats](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/biden-withdraws-from-presidential-race-but-road-remains-bumpy-for-democrats-13795718.html)

US President Joe Biden has unexpectedly dropped out of the presidential race, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as his replacement. This decision comes 100 days before the election and following  controversies surrounding Donald Trump.  The move has left the Democratic party scrambling to prepare for the convention in August. While Harris' background may resonate with progressive Democrats, her performance as Vice President and stance on key issues may be challenged by the Republicans. Several Democrats have criticized Biden's late decision and called for a review of the nomination process. Meanwhile, Trump has dismissed Biden's fitness for office, but Republicans are expected to leverage this situation to their advantage.

The article emphasizes the crucial role of women in agriculture and highlights the need to empower them through technology. It points out the existing gender disparities in access to resources, financial services, and education, which hinder women's productivity and economic growth. 

The authors argue that technology can bridge these gaps by providing women with better access to markets, information, and financial tools. They call for policy interventions that address women's unique needs, such as providing tailored credit facilities, gender-sensitive training programs, and ensuring their participation in decision-making processes. The article concludes by stressing the importance of an inclusive and equitable approach to technological advancements in agriculture to ensure sustainable development and food security.

### [The horror of Razakars haunts Bangladesh again](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/the-horror-of-razakars-haunts-bangladesh-again-13795631.html)

Protests in Bangladesh over a reinstated quota system in government jobs have turned violent, resulting in numerous casualties and significant infrastructure damage.  The High Court initially ordered the restoration of the 30% quota for the families of 1971 Liberation War veterans, leading to widespread student protests. The Supreme Court later intervened, reducing the quota to 5%. 

The situation escalated when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina questioned the rationale behind the protests, drawing parallels to the alleged collaborators known as Razakars who aided Pakistan during the war. This rhetoric ignited anger among a section of the students who feel the government is disrespecting the sacrifices of their families.

The unrest has spread beyond the streets of Dhaka, sparking violence in various parts of Bangladesh and even extending to the UK and UAE.  The protests are fueled by both socio-economic grievances and political motivations, with some alleging a deliberate attempt to destabilize the government.

A recent global IT disruption was caused by a logical error in a content update released by Crowdstrike’s Falcon Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool. The error triggered system crashes and Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) errors on Windows systems, affecting organizations across various sectors.

EDR tools, increasingly used to protect against sophisticated cyber threats, analyze behavioral patterns to detect malicious activity. Updates containing new detection rules are regularly pushed to users, but in this case, a flaw in the July 19th update led to widespread system instability. 

This incident highlights the critical need for rigorous quality checks in software development, especially in security-critical systems. Despite standard operating procedures, the error slipped through, emphasizing the potential consequences of prioritizing speed over thorough testing.

The ongoing wars in Eurasia and the Middle East highlight the failure of the international rules-based order, with countries prioritizing unilateralism and regime change.  The ICJ's ruling on Israeli settlements in the West Bank, while legally sound, lacks enforceability and faces defiance. The conflict between Israel and Gaza continues, with both sides suffering heavy casualties and displacement. While international actors like the UAE and the US are attempting to mediate, a lasting ceasefire remains elusive due to conflicting interests and a lack of commitment.  The expansion of war poses a threat to regional and global stability, with no clear path to victory for any party involved.

This article criticizes the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020 and its potential impact on India's economy. 

The author argues that the act violates constitutional principles by discriminating against non-local candidates and disrupts the free market by interfering with private employers' hiring decisions. The author cites the Punjab and Haryana High Court's ruling, which declared the act unconstitutional, and highlights the potential for  similar legislation in other states, creating an unpredictable and complex regulatory environment. 

The article draws a parallel to Silicon Valley's success, emphasizing the role of immigrants in driving innovation and economic growth. It concludes by expressing relief at Karnataka's decision to reconsider its similar bill, arguing that  restricting internal migration hinders India's potential to become a leading global tech hub.

### [Two contrasting museums that showcase Mumbai’s spirit](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/two-contrasting-museums-that-showcase-mumbais-spirit-13795346.html)

The article contrasts two Mumbai museums: The National Museum of Indian Cinema and the BEST Transport Museum.  

The National Museum of Indian Cinema, located in a posh area, offers a comprehensive journey through India's film history, showcasing rare artifacts, iconic films, and renowned personalities. Housed in a beautiful 19th-century building with a rich history, it highlights the evolution of filmmaking technology and its impact on society.

In stark contrast, the BEST Transport Museum, tucked away in a bus depot, celebrates Mumbai's urban transport system.  Through models, memorabilia, and historical anecdotes, it traces the evolution of buses from horse-drawn trams to modern vehicles, reflecting the city's economic and social development. The museum emphasizes the vital role BEST plays in Mumbai's daily life, despite lacking the widespread recognition enjoyed by the cinema museum.

The upcoming Indian Union Budget is anticipated to focus on skills, employment, and innovation to address economic challenges and opportunities.  

A key emphasis is placed on providing employable skills, especially to vulnerable populations like school dropouts. This proactive approach aims to address the shortage of skilled workers in sectors like healthcare, manufacturing, and technology, driving sustainable employment. 

Despite programs like Skill India, unemployment remains a significant concern. The government needs to prioritize effective skilling initiatives, bridge skill gaps, and address challenges with program implementation and placement support. 


A significant budget allocation for skill development, particularly for disadvantaged youth, is crucial to empower them and contribute to the nation's economic growth.

### [How long is the long arm of the American ‘Deep State’?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-long-is-the-long-arm-of-the-american-deep-state-13795297.html)

The shooting of former President Donald Trump has raised serious questions about security in the US. This incident, likened to fictional portrayals of assassination attempts, is being compared to the JFK assassination in its potential impact on American democracy. Trump supporters are claiming a "Deep State" conspiracy, echoing similar sentiments surrounding the Kennedy assassination. 

Concerns about "gun culture" in America and the Second Amendment's impact on security are reignited.  The incident also highlights the physical and mental health concerns surrounding President Biden, potentially causing further internal debate within his party. Meanwhile, the motive and identity of the attempted assassin remain unclear, and speculation about a "Deep State" connection persists.

### [Skyfall: The assassin’s bullet that Donald Trump dodged with minimal damage has hit Joe Biden instead](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/skyfall-the-assassins-bullet-that-donald-trump-dodged-with-minimal-damage-has-hit-joe-biden-instead-13795247.html)

This article analyzes the week in American politics following Trump's assassination attempt and the Republican National Convention, contrasting his bounce back with Biden's struggles.  Trump  is portrayed as revived, united with a seemingly stronger Republican party,  fundraising exceptionally well, and even appearing more dignified and “calm.” 

Conversely, Biden is painted as  vulnerable, facing pressure to step down from his party, including from key Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and even Obama, while his health and age are increasingly scrutinized by the media.

The article concludes that the political tide has turned in Trump's favor, while Biden seems to be losing ground. This event has solidified Trump's position within the Republican Party, and the public perception of him might be shifting towards a more sympathetic and relatable figure, despite the opposition’s efforts to portray him negatively.

The article discusses India's balancing act between maintaining relations with Russia and the West, particularly in light of the war in Ukraine. 

While acknowledging the West's attempts to isolate Russia, the author argues that India's decision to engage with Russia is strategically necessary due to their shared history, geographic proximity, and Russia's ability to disrupt the region.  

The author emphasizes that India needs to maintain a good relationship with Russia while also not overlooking the importance of its ties with the West. They caution against an overreliance on Russia and highlight the limitations of the economic relationship between the two countries. Ultimately, the article concludes that India must carefully navigate this complex geopolitical landscape to secure its own interests.

This article argues that India's current strategy towards Pakistan's sponsored terrorism is flawed due to a misunderstanding of the roots of the problem. It highlights the common belief in India's political and diplomatic circles that the India-Pakistan conflict is primarily geopolitical, while Pakistan sees it as an existential and religious war. 

The author, citing the recent upsurge in terrorist attacks in Jammu and Kashmir, suggests that this war is perceived by Pakistan as a "jihad" against Hindus and that India needs a long-term, strategic solution rather than a reactive approach. 

He points out Pakistan's long history of manipulating the conflict through various tactics, including manipulating Kashmir's political landscape and exploiting communal tensions within India to fuel radicalization. The article concludes by emphasizing the need to move beyond superficial analysis and acknowledge the religious undercurrent driving the conflict, urging India to formulate a comprehensive and lasting solution.

The article argues for strategic investments in India's education system, particularly focusing on foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN). 

Despite increased education spending, learning outcomes remain low, highlighting the need for targeted interventions. The National Initiative for Proficiency in Reading with Understanding and Numeracy (NIPUN) Bharat Mission aims to improve FLN by 2026-27. However, the article suggests reforms in funding and implementation.

It recommends shifting from annual to three-year rolling disbursements to allow states more time for efficient utilization. Key investment areas include early childhood education, teacher training, school-based assessments, and awareness campaigns. The article emphasizes the long-term impact of these investments on economic growth, social equity, and individual well-being.

KP Sharma Oli's return as Nepal's Prime Minister signals a potential shift in the country's foreign policy, with a renewed emphasis on China. Oli, known for his anti-India stance, has consistently strengthened Nepal's ties with Beijing. His previous terms saw agreements on the BRI and military exercises, and he sought an extradition treaty with China, though ultimately withdrawn due to pressure. 

Oli's policies aim to counter Indian influence and Western engagement in Nepal. This includes addressing the presence of Tibetan refugees, a sensitive issue for China, and potentially limiting the reach of the US-funded MCC program.  While Oli's coalition partner, the Nepali Congress, seeks a more balanced approach, Oli's pro-China leanings are expected to significantly shape Nepal's international relations.

China, once an economic powerhouse with double-digit growth, is facing a slowdown to single-digit rates, with predictions of further deceleration. The real estate sector, a key driver of growth, is in crisis, fueled by government policies and the pandemic. 

Stimulus measures and attempts to boost consumer demand haven't been successful. Exports are also faltering due to a high trade deficit and global backlash against China's economic and geopolitical policies. 

Aging population and rising labor costs further compound the problem. 

Despite a focus on advanced manufacturing and technology, China's efforts to move up the value chain are facing hurdles due to global market resistance. With domestic and international markets proving challenging, China's future economic growth trajectory remains uncertain.

Recent developments in the South Caucasus, including a direct flight route between China and Armenia, signal a growing Chinese presence in the region. This move coincides with heightened Sino-American tensions and China's efforts to solidify partnerships with countries who face US pressure.  

China's economic investments and trade ties with most South Caucasus nations, coupled with its support for Russia, Turkey, and Iran, present potential challenges to India's interests in the region. India seeks to utilize the International North-South Trade Corridor (INSTC) for connectivity and counter the perceived alignment of Turkey, Pakistan, and Azerbaijan. 

While Armenia's position leaves some room for India's engagement,  China's expanding influence through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative, and its backing of Azerbaijan's original route for the INSTC, poses a significant obstacle to India's aspirations in the South Caucasus.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's recent trip to China yielded minimal results, prompting Dhaka to seek financial support from India for the Teesta River redevelopment project.  India's potential investment could resolve water sharing disputes, boost economic cooperation, and counter China's influence in the region. However,  India must carefully weigh potential domestic backlash in West Bengal against the strategic benefits. Bangladesh, although facing economic vulnerabilities and socio-political challenges, presents an opportunity for India to strengthen its regional standing.  The Teesta project symbolizes the evolving relationship between the two nations, offering the potential for shared prosperity while requiring careful navigation of complex issues.

The 22nd Annual Bilateral Summit between India and Russia focused on strengthening cooperation in trade, economics, and investment, particularly in the Russian Far East and Arctic. This partnership is significant as China's growing influence in the Arctic, driven by its economic investments and military ambitions, presents a challenge to traditional Arctic stakeholders.  India's engagement with Russia in the Arctic is seen as a counterbalance to China's growing assertiveness. 

While Russia benefits from China's economic support, concerns exist that Beijing's growing power could eventually overshadow Moscow's interests. India's growing interest in Arctic affairs stems partly from its need for secure access to critical minerals, which the Arctic region holds in abundance.  
 
 Prime Minister Modi's recent visit to Moscow highlighted the importance of India's role in balancing the geopolitical dynamics in the Arctic.  India's diplomatic efforts and 'Whole of Government Approach' are crucial for ensuring its secure and responsible presence in this strategically important region.

Masoud Pezeshkian's victory in Iran's recent presidential election signals a potential shift in foreign policy, with optimism surrounding a revival of the 2015 nuclear deal. Pezeshkian's likely foreign minister, Javed Zarif, played a key role in negotiating the original deal. 

However, obstacles remain. The US withdrew from the deal in 2018 under Donald Trump and remains hesitant to guarantee against future withdrawals. Iran also seeks assurance regarding the lifting of sanctions against its Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.  

Furthermore, regional dynamics, including the ongoing war in Gaza and a recent reconciliation between Iran and Saudi Arabia, complicate the situation. While some analysts believe Iran may prefer a "nuclear latency" strategy, the potential benefits of a revived deal, particularly in easing economic sanctions on the Iranian people, could drive negotiations.

It highlights the danger of hate speech, particularly after the attempted assassination of former US President Donald Trump. The article draws parallels between the rhetoric used by some Indian opposition leaders against Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the vitriol directed at Trump. 

The author argues that such attacks, while potentially beneficial for the incumbent in the short term, ultimately damage the attacker's credibility and reputation.  The article concludes by suggesting that opposition parties should focus on policy issues and offer viable alternatives instead of resorting to personal attacks.

Clashes erupted at Dhaka University and other campuses in Bangladesh following a High Court order reinstating a quota system for government jobs reserved for the children of freedom fighters. The decision, initially scrapped in 2018, triggered protests from students demanding a merit-based system. The violence has resulted in several deaths and injuries, prompting the University Grants Commission to close all universities pending further instructions.  

This unrest echoes Dhaka University's history of student activism and rebellion, dating back to the Language Movement of the 1950s and the Bangladesh Liberation War in 1971 where the campus witnessed violent crackdowns. While the current situation is deemed unfortunate and avoidable, it highlights the long-standing political tensions surrounding educational opportunities in Bangladesh.

Germany's left-leaning government, while criticizing India's policies, is increasingly resorting to authoritarian tactics at home.  The government has shut down a right-wing magazine, Compact, citing it as a mouthpiece for extremism, and frozen the bank accounts of those who donated to far-right groups. This move, justified as a threat to the constitution, is seen as a suppression of dissent and a violation of freedom of speech.  The government's actions are driven by a desire to weaken the growing influence of the right-wing AfD party, which has gained popularity due to public frustration with the government's handling of issues like immigration and the economy. This crackdown raises concerns about the erosion of democratic principles in Germany.

### [Rising terror attacks in Jammu signal new threats](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/rising-terror-attacks-in-jammu-signal-new-threats-13793822.html)

Terrorist activity in Jammu, a region historically less affected by militancy, has increased significantly in the past year. This shift is attributed to Pakistan-based terror groups moving their focus from the Kashmir Valley, where security is stronger, to the more vulnerable Jammu region. The growing insecurity in Jammu coincides with the abrogation of Article 370,  which Pakistan views as an infringement on its interests. 

India aims to counter this threat through stricter security measures, including heightened operations and asset freezes against terrorist organizations.  However, the deployment of security forces to Ladakh due to  border tensions with China has created a security vacuum in Jammu.  The government is aware of the threat and is taking steps to address it, recognizing the need to adapt its strategies to the evolving nature of terrorism in the region.

JD Vance's surprising nomination as Republican VP candidate has sparked criticism from "liberals" due to his background as a poor, white individual from the Rust Belt. While Vance's life story, detailed in his bestselling book "Hillbilly Elegy," resonates with many Americans, his conservative views and outspoken nature have drawn fire. His appointment, however, is seen by some as a strategic move by Trump to appeal to younger voters and solidify the Republican base. Supporters point to Vance's own journey from poverty to success and his willingness to challenge conventional political thought as signs of his potential. Despite his young age and previous criticism of Trump, Vance's selection signifies a generational shift within the Republican party and his role as a potential future frontrunner. His marriage to Usha, a registered Democrat,  further adds to the narrative of finding common ground despite political differences.

A recent study reveals alarmingly high sugar content in baby food products sold in India, Africa, and Latin America compared to European counterparts. This raises concerns about early exposure to sugar and its long-term impact on children's dietary preferences and health.  

The trend of ultra-processed food (UPF) consumption is also surging in developing countries, linked to increased obesity, diabetes, and other health problems.  A shift from traditional staples to processed foods is observed, highlighting the influence of food multinational corporations (MNCs) who aggressively market unhealthy products in these regions.

Governments must strengthen regulations to ensure food products, especially those targeted at children, meet nutritional standards. They should also encourage healthier dietary practices and promote traditional diets to counteract the negative effects of these trends.

### [Not only machines, but men behind them: Getting Indian Army future-ready](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/not-only-machines-but-men-behind-them-getting-indian-army-future-ready-13793530.html)

This article examines the crucial role of technology in modern warfare and the balancing act the Indian Army must undertake between human resource reforms and force modernization. 

It highlights how technology has continuously reshaped the character of war, from the Industrial Revolution to the modern era of AI and autonomous systems. While acknowledging the impact of technology, the article stresses that it is not a guarantee of victory. 

The author emphasizes the importance of human factors like esprit de corps and regimental cohesion, asserting that technology alone cannot replace the human element in warfare.  

The article concludes with the challenge facing the Indian defense establishment: finding the right equilibrium between cost-cutting human resource practices and investments in crucial military modernization.

### [How BIMSTEC in east and IMEC in west can make India central to Asian-European connectivity](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-bimstec-in-east-and-imec-in-west-can-make-india-central-to-asian-european-connectivity-13793487.html)

Prime Minister Modi's recent diplomatic maneuvers, including his visit to Moscow, signal a strengthening of India's ties with Russia while navigating a complex geopolitical landscape.  

 India's longstanding strategic partnership with Russia, rooted in historical ties and shared concerns about China's growing influence, is becoming increasingly relevant in the context of the ongoing tensions between the West and Russia. BIMSTEC, a regional organization dominated by India, is emerging as a potential counterweight to China's growing presence in the Indo-Pacific. India's investment in infrastructure projects in coastal regions, particularly Andhra Pradesh,  further strengthens its strategic positioning in the Bay of Bengal.

The potential for BIMSTEC to develop into a major trade corridor, connecting India with Southeast Asia, the Gulf Cooperation Council, and Europe, presents a significant opportunity for India to solidify its regional role and counter China's dominance.

### [Securing supply chains: Why critical minerals are important aspect of Indo-American partnership](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/securing-supply-chains-why-critical-minerals-are-important-aspect-of-indo-american-partnership-13793358.html)

A transforming US-India defense and security partnership, marked by the India-US Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET), now includes critical minerals. This collaboration aims to reduce reliance on imports and strengthen supply chains for key sectors like defense and clean energy.

Both the US and India are working to enhance domestic capabilities in mining, processing, and utilizing critical minerals.  India possesses vast reserves of rare earth elements, and initiatives are underway to develop self-sufficiency. In the US, projects like Round Top, coupled with policy measures like the ORE Act, are bolstering its strategic mineral capacity.  

The iCET expansion entails co-investments in lithium and rare earth projects, a bilateral MOU for cooperation on critical minerals, and collaborative R&D in advanced materials. This partnership strengthens national security, promotes innovation, and sets an example for global cooperation in securing critical resources.

### [25 years of Kargil war: When Indian armed forces achieved near impossible](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/25-years-of-kargil-war-when-indian-armed-forces-achieved-near-impossible-13793301.html)

The Kargil conflict of 1999 saw Pakistan infiltrate Indian territory, prompting a fierce Indian military response.  Despite facing formidable challenges, including high-altitude terrain and restrictions on military operations, Indian troops successfully evicted the Pakistani intruders. 

The conflict showcased the bravery and resilience of the Indian armed forces, with numerous gallantry awards being bestowed upon soldiers. The Indian Air Force also played a crucial role, conducting air strikes and demonstrating the effectiveness of airpower in mountainous warfare.

The Kargil conflict had significant geopolitical implications, undermining Pakistan's international standing and solidifying India's position as a rising military power. It also underscored the importance of a strong military deterrent in safeguarding national security.

### [Israel-Lebanon conflict and chances of a full-scale war](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/israel-lebanon-conflict-and-chances-of-a-full-scale-war-13793231.html)

The Israel-Lebanon conflict has a long history, marked by wars and tensions.  Hezbollah's attacks on Israel in recent months have escalated the situation, leading to a significant exchange of fire. While 61% of Israelis support military action against Hezbollah, a majority also favor an international political solution.  

Israel possesses a strong military advantage and is backed by the United States.  However, the unpredictable nature of war and the potential for international involvement introduce elements of uncertainty. The current Israeli government may see war as a way to divert attention from internal political issues and bolster support. 

The potential for a full-scale war remains a concern, with the outcome heavily influenced by political considerations and the calculations of both sides.

### [Trump assassination attempt: Why it's noteworthy for India](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/donald-trump-assassination-attempt-lessons-for-india-13793174.html)

A would-be assassin shot at Donald Trump during a rally in Pennsylvania, narrowly missing him. The incident, which was witnessed by thousands and quickly captured on social media, has drawn intense media scrutiny and political commentary.

While mainstream media outlets initially struggled to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation, the attack has undoubtedly become a defining moment in the 2024 US presidential campaign. It has also sparked concerns about the increasing hostility and polarization in American politics, with accusations that anti-Trump rhetoric has fueled violence. 

The article argues that the media, particularly leftist outlets, has played a role in demonizing Trump, creating an environment where violence against him becomes more acceptable. It further suggests that the incident is a warning for India, highlighting the vulnerability of political leaders to violence and urging Indian security agencies to take note.

### [China’s Panchsheel embrace: A smokescreen for aggression](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/chinas-panchsheel-embrace-a-smokescreen-for-aggression-13793123.html)

China recently hosted a conference marking the 70th anniversary of the Panchsheel (Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence). While China now emphasizes the Panchsheel, its actions haven't aligned with its principles, especially towards India.  

China's occupation of Indian territory, support for Pakistan amidst ongoing tensions, and interference in Kashmir are cited as blatant violations of Panchsheel tenets.  The author argues that China's current revival of the Panchsheel is a tactic to deflect criticism from its global actions and calls on India to be wary of this manipulation.

### [Bhupinder Singh Rawat: Remembering the ‘Scooter’ who raced his way to success in Indian football](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bhupinder-singh-rawat-remembering-the-scooter-who-raced-his-way-to-success-in-indian-football-13792991.html)

Bhupinder Singh Rawat, nicknamed "Scooter" for his remarkable pace, was a highly regarded Indian footballer. Despite his short stature, he excelled as a center forward, known for his speed, accuracy, and ability to score headers. He gained prominence during the 1966 Durand Cup, where he scored 12 goals, becoming the tournament's highest scorer. Rawat's exceptional skills earned him a place in the Indian team for the 1969 Merdeka Cup. After retiring from football, he pursued coaching and later settled in Surat, Gujarat, where he passed away in June 2024.

### [Yes, Nehru played a role in Austria’s emergence as independent nation, but that’s just half the story](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/yes-nehru-played-a-role-in-austrias-emergence-as-independent-nation-but-thats-just-half-the-story-13792963.html)

The article debunks the discredited Austrian "first victim" theory, which claimed Austria was a victim of Nazi Germany. 

Austria, a landlocked country surrounded by powerful neighbors in the 1930s, saw the rise of fascism and eventually was annexed by Nazi Germany in 1938. Despite claims of minimal resistance, Austria was deeply complicit in Nazi crimes, with Austrians making up a disproportionate number of concentration camp leaders and perpetrators of the Holocaust. 

Although the "first victim" narrative was convenient for Austria after the war, it served to minimize their responsibility for the atrocities committed on their soil and to avoid paying reparations to victims. The theory has since been debunked, but the article highlights how it lingers in certain circles, demanding  a full account of Austrian history and its entanglement with Nazism.

### [Bloodied but unbeaten: Trump gets a shot at immortality](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/donald-trump-usa-assassination-attempt-13792934.html)

An assassination attempt on Donald Trump in Pennsylvania has highlighted security lapses and reignited discussions about political violence in the US. The incident, where a young man fired shots at Trump, injuring a bystander, has raised questions about whether the security detail adequately secured the event, particularly given the heightened rhetoric surrounding Trump and calls for his political defeat. 

Comparisons are drawn to historical instances of political assassinations, including those of US presidents, and the potential influence of anti-Trump sentiment.  Further scrutiny is focused on the shooter's supposed political affiliation, with emerging information suggesting a previous donation to a Democratic political organization. 


The incident has emphasized the fragility of democratic processes and the alarming trend of political violence.

### [First anniversary of Chandrayaan-3 mission: When India pioneered landing on lunar south pole](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/first-anniversary-of-chandrayaan-3-mission-when-india-pioneered-landing-on-lunar-south-pole-13792950.html)

India's Chandrayaan-3 mission achieved a historic soft landing near the lunar south pole, making India the fourth country to successfully land a spacecraft on the moon and the first to reach the south pole. The mission included a lander and rover that functioned normally for one lunar day, collecting valuable scientific data.  

Crucially, Chandrayaan-3 confirmed the presence of sulphur on the lunar surface and detected other elements like calcium, aluminium, iron, titanium, manganese, chromium, and silicon. ISRO is continuing to analyze data for the presence of hydrogen. 

This success is part of India's larger lunar exploration program, which began with Chandrayaan-1 in 2008 and includes the ongoing Chandrayaan-2 orbiter. ISRO's future plans include the Gaganyaan program to send Indian astronauts into space and Chandrayaan-4, which will return lunar samples to Earth.

### [Harnessing innovation to meet India's net zero emissions goals by 2070](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/innovation-to-meet-indias-net-zero-emissions-goals-by-2070-13792906.html)

India, the world’s third-largest energy consumer, faces the challenge of decarbonising its energy mix heavily reliant on fossil fuels. To achieve its net-zero goals by 2070, India must drive technological innovation in key areas. 

Waste-to-energy, alternative fuels like green hydrogen, and advancements in battery chemistries are crucial for reducing reliance on fossil fuels and enhancing renewable energy integration. Innovative battery recycling solutions are essential to address the growing waste from lithium-ion batteries, while distributed renewable energy systems can improve energy access and resilience.  A multi-faceted approach involving government support, private sector investment, and public-private partnerships is key to driving these innovations and securing a sustainable energy future for India.

### [Much more than a bear hug: Analysing India-Russia relations](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/on-india-russia-relations-13792883.html)

Prime Minister Modi's summit with Russian President Putin, while reaffirming dialogue and diplomacy, sent a message about India's priorities. 

India's stance on the Ukraine war, advocating for peace while abstaining from UN votes condemning Russia, allows other Global South nations to follow suit.  Furthermore,  India's purchase of Russian oil despite Western sanctions sets a precedent for defying international pressure. 

The bilateral trade commitment of $100 billion by 2030 and the shift to local currencies strengthen the economic partnership. India also secured the release and compensation for Indian mercenaries fighting in Ukraine. This event highlights India's diplomatic maneuvering in a complex geopolitical landscape.

### [Modi-Putin summit: America must understand that it cannot make India abandon Russia](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/modi-putin-summit-america-must-understand-that-it-cannot-make-india-abandon-russia-13792841.html)

The article analyzes India's recent visit to Moscow amidst the backdrop of NATO's strong stance against Russia. It points out the stark contrast between the US's demand for India to distance itself from Russia and NATO's effort to maintain "constructive engagement" with China, despite Beijing's support for Russia's actions. 

The author argues that India has strong reasons to continue engaging with Russia, due to their long-standing relationship and shared interests.  India's strategic autonomy allows it to maintain balanced relationships with multiple powers, including both Russia and the West.

The article criticizes the US's  attempts to dictate India's foreign policy choices,  highlighting the inconsistencies in American approach towards China and Russia. 
It concludes by suggesting that  India's engagement with Russia, aimed at promoting peace and de-escalation, is a valuable contribution to the global effort, and underscores the need for the US to adapt to a multipolar world order.

### [US envoy’s ‘undiplomatic’ rant on PM Modi’s Russia visit: It’s time America stopped taking India for granted](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/us-envoys-undiplomatic-rant-on-pm-modis-russia-visit-its-time-america-stopped-taking-india-for-granted-13792681.html)

The article analyzes the recent visit of Prime Minister Modi to Moscow amidst the NATO summit in Washington.  It highlights the strategic significance of India's relationship with Russia, particularly in light of the ongoing Ukraine war. The author argues that while India maintains its neutrality in the conflict, the timing of the visit sends a strong message,  especially considering the US's attempts to influence India's stance. 

The piece  criticizes the US's double standards in foreign policy, pointing out its inconsistencies in dealing with both democratic allies and authoritarian regimes. It emphasizes the need for the US to adopt a more nuanced and diplomatic approach towards India, acknowledging its autonomy and interests.

### [How 'scarcity' of competent South Asian scholars mars perception of Indian democracy in West](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-scarcity-of-competent-south-asian-scholars-mars-perception-of-indian-democracy-in-west-13792606.html)

This article critiques the coverage of Indian elections in US media, arguing that it relies too heavily on perspectives from non-Indian scholars who lack a deep understanding of Indian complexities. It specifically challenges Sadanand Dhume's op-ed, "Modi’s BJP Has a Diversity Problem," which blames the BJP for the underrepresentation of Muslims in Indian politics and cites their lack of support for the party as a result of its "Hindutva" agenda. 

The author contends that Dhume's analysis ignores historical and political context, pointing to the declining Muslim representation in parliament despite a growing Muslim population and the often-anti-BJP stance of so-called secularist parties. 

The article further argues that  a desire for Islamic supremacy within some Muslim communities contributes to the lack of support for the BJP, and that Muslims cannot be effectively represented only by Muslim politicians.

### [Terror and talks can’t go together: Why India should not resume cricket diplomacy with Pakistan](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/terror-and-talks-cant-go-together-why-india-should-not-resume-cricket-diplomacy-with-pakistan-13792571.html)

The article discusses the potential for India to participate in the 2025 ICC Champions Trophy, hosted in Pakistan.  It highlights security concerns due to a recent increase in terrorist incidents in Jammu and Kashmir, particularly citing the Reasi and Kathua attacks. 

India's participation hinges on the government's decision, weighing the desires of cricket fans against the safety of the team and the broader geopolitical context.  The writer argues that Pakistan's continued use of terror as a tool against India makes dialogue and comprehensive engagement unsustainable. 

The article also emphasizes the importance of India's diplomatic efforts, including persuading international bodies like the IMF and engaging with other nations, particularly Britain, to pressure Pakistan into abandoning terrorism as a policy.

### [Iran at crossroads: How election of a new president can herald better Tehran-West ties](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/iran-at-crossroads-how-election-of-a-new-president-can-herald-better-tehran-west-ties-13792393.html)

The election of Masoud Pezeshkian as Iran's president has generated significant global interest and hope for change. Despite limitations imposed by the Iranian political system, his reformist agenda and focus on engagement with the West offer a potential shift in Iran's regional and international policies. Pezeshkian's victory signifies a growing desire within Iran for liberal reforms and a move away from international isolation.  

This presents a strategic opportunity for the West, particularly the US, to engage with Iran and curb its growing ties with China and Russia.  Iran-Arab normalization further emphasizes this potential for change, creating a more peaceful and cooperative regional environment. 

Beyond regional impacts, the new Iranian presidency could benefit India through enhanced trade, energy security, and cooperation on maritime and continental security. The outcome heavily depends on the US's response, Israel's actions in the Gaza war, and Iran's willingness to engage with the West and revive the JCPOA.

### [Pakistan Supreme Court verdict on reserved seats in national and provincial assemblies: A big boost to Imran Khan](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/pakistan-supreme-court-verdict-on-reserved-seats-in-national-and-provincial-assemblies-a-big-boost-to-imran-khan-13792331.html)

The Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled in a 8-5 decision that 80 National Assembly members who contested the February elections as Independents are eligible to be recognized as members of the Pakistan Tehreek-Insaaf (PTI).  The court overturned previous judgments that had deemed these candidates Independents and barred the PTI from its election symbol. This decision ensures the PTI's recognition as a valid political party and allows them to nominate candidates for reserved seats in the National and Provincial Assemblies. Although the ruling benefits the PTI, it is unlikely to significantly impact the current parliamentary majority held by the ruling coalition.

### [Japan-Philippines Defence Pact: Countering the Dragon, championing new dynamics in South China Sea](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/japan-philippines-defence-pact-countering-the-dragon-championing-new-dynamics-in-south-china-sea-13792296.html)

The Japan-Philippines Reciprocal Access Agreement (RAA) is a significant development in regional security, particularly in light of growing tensions in the South China Sea.  

The agreement, signed in July 2024, allows for increased joint military exercises and the exchange of defense equipment and technology. This strengthening of defense cooperation comes at a crucial time when both Japan and the Philippines face maritime territorial disputes with China. The RAA provides a platform for Japan and the Philippines to work together to deter China's assertive actions and uphold the rules-based order in the Indo-Pacific. 

The pact is also seen as a move away from reliance on a single security provider, with both countries seeking to take a more active role in their own defense.

### [Modi’s visit to Russia: An urge for strategic autonomy in a polarised world](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/modis-visit-to-russia-an-urge-for-strategic-autonomy-in-a-polarised-world-13792168.html)

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Russia was significant amidst global tensions, including the conflicts in Ukraine and Gaza. India, while maintaining a neutral stance on the Russia-Ukraine war, reaffirmed its commitment to peace. The visit underscored India's strategic autonomy, balancing close ties with both Russia and the US while navigating the complex relationship between these power players.  

India's dependence on Russian arms imports and its pursuit of economic interests, including purchasing discounted Russian energy, were key factors in its stance. The visit was marked by the signing of agreements in trade, economics, and investment, highlighting the enduring economic partnership between the two nations.  India's delicate balancing act in these global power dynamics will continue to be a defining feature of its foreign policy.

### [Rumble in South China Sea: Bellicose China versus law-abiding others](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/rumble-in-south-china-sea-bellicose-china-versus-law-abiding-others-13791977.html)

China's growing assertiveness in the South China Sea, marked by confrontations with neighboring countries, has sparked a shift in regional dynamics. 

Despite recent overtures of "restoring trust," past actions including harassment of fishermen and violations of international law have led to a growing backlash. Countries like the Philippines, Japan, India, and the US are bolstering their military capabilities and forming alliances to counter China's aggression. 

The International Court of Arbitration ruling in favor of the Philippines in 2016, which China refuses to recognize, further complicates the situation. 

The South China Sea's vital role in global trade and maritime security amplifies the stakes, pushing a region accustomed to diplomatic talks towards an increasingly militarized posture.

### [Don’t take them seriously! Anti-India bias runs deep in human rights groups in West](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/dont-take-them-seriously-anti-india-bias-runs-deep-in-human-rights-groups-in-west-13791940.html)

The article criticizes human rights organizations like Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch for their biased and often inaccurate reporting, particularly concerning India.  

The author argues that these groups prioritize political agendas over objective analysis, pointing to examples of past errors and questionable methodologies.  They claim that these organizations have a history of supporting controversial regimes and engaging in self-dealing, motivated by financial gain and career advancement. The author also highlights the hypocrisy of criticizing India while ignoring human rights abuses in other countries, such as Pakistan. 

Ultimately, the article condemns the subjective nature of these organizations' work, suggesting that their reports lack credibility and should be dismissed as political propaganda.

India's relationship with Russia is complex, encompassing both enduring cooperation and emerging challenges. While India benefits from Russian defence technology, including the S-400 missile system and Sukhoi fighter jets, a significant trade deficit and Russia's close ties with China pose limitations. India seeks deeper partnerships, particularly in defence technology transfer, but Russia's involvement in the Ukraine war and silence on Chinese aggression in the Himalayas create geopolitical hurdles. Despite Prime Minister Modi's efforts to strengthen ties, the partnership remains influenced by external factors, particularly the ongoing conflict in Ukraine and the India-China border dispute.

### [Sunita Williams saga exposes gaps in protecting astronauts](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/sunita-williams-saga-exposes-gaps-in-protecting-astronauts-13791767.html)

Space exploration, guided by international law, necessitates a global commitment to astronaut health. This includes the fundamental right to health as outlined in the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.  

History shows a progression towards codifying international space law, beginning with the Declaration of Legal Principles Governing the Activities of States in 1963 and culminating in the Rescue Agreement for Astronauts in 1968.  

Given the evolving nature of space activities, especially considering long-duration missions,  a new international norm prioritizing astronaut health is crucial. This norm should encompass preventative measures, robust rescue protocols, and a shared responsibility for astronaut well-being.
