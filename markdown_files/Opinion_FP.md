### [Why a Chinese report on American hands in regime changes is worth considering](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-a-chinese-report-on-american-hands-in-regime-changes-is-worth-considering-13806543.html)

The Chinese Foreign Ministry report "The National Endowment for Democracy: What It Is and What It Does?" criticizes the NED for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. 

The report alleges that the NED supports pro-US forces, manipulates elections, and incites division to undermine stability. It specifically accuses the NED of funding Uyghur and Tibetan groups considered anti-state by China, citing financial support to organizations like the World Uyghur Congress and individuals like Hidayet Oguzhan and Rushan Abbas. 

The report also highlights articles published in the Journal of Democracy, a publication associated with the NED, that question the effectiveness of Indian democracy. 


China calls on countries to be aware of the NED's true intentions and protect their national sovereignty and interests.

### [How social inequality fuels ‘godmen’ culture](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-social-inequality-fuels-godmen-culture-13806496.html)

This article discusses the alarming rise of exploitative "godmen" in India,  highlighting their abuse of power and wealth. 

While India boasts genuine saints who promote inner peace and selflessness, a  disconcerting number of self-proclaimed gurus exploit poverty, caste inequality, and superstition for personal gain. 

Examples like Bhole Baba, Asaram Bapu, and Gurmeet Ram Rahim Singh demonstrate how these figures amass wealth, influence, and impunity, often securing political protection despite accusations of sexual assault, murder, and other crimes.  The article argues that the root causes of this phenomenon are India's deep-seated social problems, including  caste discrimination and economic disparity, which make vulnerable populations susceptible to their manipulative tactics.  The author emphasizes the need for comprehensive social and economic reforms to address the underlying issues and prevent continued exploitation.

### [Could Moneyball methodology improve Indian cricket?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/could-moneyball-methodology-improve-indian-cricket-13806487.html)

The Indian Premier League (IPL), a driving force behind India's cricketing success, uses awards and rankings to recognize player performance. However, the current system relies on limited and questionable metrics. 

Analyzing IPL data, a group of students developed a new Most Valuable Player (MVP) formula based on multivariate regression. This new system considers batting efficiency and consistency, bowling control and wicket-taking, and fielding impact, leading to a stronger correlation between MVP scores and team win percentages.  

The revised metrics highlight the importance of strike rate, economy rate, and fielding contributions, offering a more comprehensive assessment of player value. This Moneyball approach could elevate the competition within the IPL and potentially contribute to India's dominance in world cricket.

Bangladesh is facing a critical period of instability following Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's resignation and the government's move to designate Islamist groups as militant organizations. This has led to violence, the resurgence of extremist groups like Jama'at Mujahideen Bangladesh and Ansar-al Islam, and a rise in sectarian tensions.

International players, including Pakistan and potentially the US, are suspected to be meddling in Bangladesh's internal affairs, seeking to exploit the situation for their strategic gains.  India, concerned about potential spillover effects on its security, needs to remain vigilant and supportive of efforts to maintain stability in Bangladesh.  


The situation highlights the fragility of Bangladesh's social fabric and the potential for further violence if extremist forces gain a foothold.

China and the Philippines continue to clash over territorial claims in the South China Sea, despite a recent understanding aimed at reducing tensions.  Chinese coast guard vessels are increasingly engaging in aggressive maneuvers around the disputed Second Thomas Shoal, including ramming and water cannon attacks on Philippine supply ships.  

China asserts historical sovereignty over the region, while the Philippines relies on the 2016 UNCLOS Permanent Court of Arbitration ruling that invalidated China's 9-dash-line claim. 

Recent developments, including a renewed Philippines-US Mutual Defence Treaty and a Philippine commitment to pursue lawful activities in the disputed waters, suggest the Philippines is taking a stronger stance against Chinese pressure. Beijing needs to adapt its strategy, recognizing the Philippines' increased assertiveness and the limitations of its deterrence tactics.

The article examines accusations of US covert regime change efforts in Bangladesh, focusing on the strategic motivation behind such actions and their potential consequences. 

The strategic importance of Bangladesh's location, particularly its ports and access to the Bay of Bengal, is highlighted as a reason for potential US interest in influencing the country's political landscape. The article draws comparisons to past US interventions, such as the 1953 coup in Iran and the 2014 Maidan Revolution in Ukraine, emphasizing the potential for instability and unforeseen repercussions. 

Drawing on historical examples and academic research, the article argues that while regime change may seem like a strategic advantage in the short term, it often leads to long-term instability, weakens democratic institutions, and triggers resentment among the populace. 


Finally, the article underscores the potential risks this intervention poses to Bangladesh and the region, urging India and other stakeholders to closely monitor the situation and work towards maintaining regional stability.

Ukraine's surprise ground offensive into Russia's Kursk region has captured international attention. This audacious move, involving the seizure of significant territory, has shifted the narrative of the war and created a strategic dilemma for Russia. 

The Ukrainian operation raises several questions: What are Ukraine's aims - to weaken Russia's forces, gain leverage in potential negotiations, or something else?  How will Russia respond? Will it escalate the conflict, try to repel the incursion, or use the situation to pressure for negotiations?  The success of this operation, as well as its potential consequences, remains to be seen.

The author cites events like the COVID-19 pandemic, the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the Israel-Hamas war, and political instability in various regions as examples of this present crisis.  Echoing Sri Aurobindo, the article emphasizes the need for India to stay true to its values of personal freedom and decentralized governance, urging bold policies and increased innovation.  India is positioned to navigate this turbulent era by staying independent of global pressures and focusing on its own strengths.

They also point to the low likelihood of India, which currently wins few medals, being successful in hosting the Olympics profitably. Instead, the author proposes focusing on building grassroots sports infrastructure to develop a stronger sporting culture at the national level before considering a bid to host the Olympics.

### [Why PM Modi's visit Ukraine and Poland will be closely watched](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-pm-modis-visit-ukraine-and-poland-will-be-closely-watched-13805817.html)

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Poland and Ukraine marks a significant diplomatic move, as it is the first time an Indian PM has visited Poland in 40 years. 

Modi aims to build stronger ties with both countries, focusing on defense and strategic alignment with Poland.  His visit to Ukraine follows a controversial trip to Russia, where he received Russia's highest civilian honor. 

India seeks to establish a mediating role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, while also pursuing bilateral economic interests.  The relationship with Ukraine is marked by historical ties, trade agreements, and India's support for Ukraine's territorial integrity. Meanwhile, India’s relationship with Poland is witnessing a resurgence, with increasing defense collaboration and trade partnerships.


Modi's visit comes at a delicate time, with Poland being a staunch supporter of Ukraine and critical of India's continued engagement with Russia.

The article argues that US foreign policy, particularly its interventions in other countries, has often been detrimental.  

The author points to instances like Ukraine, Afghanistan, and Iran, where US-backed regime changes resulted in instability and suffering. The piece criticizes the US for prioritizing its own interests over genuine diplomacy and supporting anti-government groups, even those with questionable backgrounds or ties to radical ideologies. 

The recent coup in Bangladesh is used as a case study, alleging that US involvement in undermining the elected government has contributed to a rise in extremism and instability in the region. Comparing the US approach to India’s more conservative foreign policy, the author suggests that the US’s focus on regime change often backfires, leaving countries worse off and serving its own strategic goals at the expense of democracy and human rights.

The article discusses how Western media, driven by powerful interests, manipulates narratives to shape public opinion.  It highlights the speed and efficiency of this manipulation in the digital age, citing examples like the sudden change in portrayal of figures like Manuel Noriega and Sheikh Hasina.  The author argues that platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Wikipedia, driven by algorithms and potentially biased editors, contribute to this process, creating a system of "truth by repeated assertion." The author concludes by advocating for a drastic solution, emulating the Chinese firewall to protect against Western influence and fostering indigenous knowledge systems.

Following a military-engineered coup, Sheikh Hasina, the former Prime Minister of Bangladesh, sought refuge in India. Charges of murder and other crimes have been brought against her, but these lack substantial legal grounding and were filed after her departure.  India, which enjoys strong diplomatic ties with Bangladesh, is unlikely to extradite Hasina, given her past contributions to the country's stability and economic growth. India is also concerned about potential human rights violations and the safety of Bangladeshi Hindus following the coup. It remains to be seen how the new interim government, led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus, will manage the situation and whether it has the legitimacy to pursue Hasina's extradition. India's position is crucial for Bangladesh's security and economic well-being, and any strain in relations could benefit rival powers.

India, despite its progress, remains home to the largest number of child brides globally, with one in three residing in the country. Child marriage, primarily affecting girls in rural areas and poorer households, leads to pregnancy complications, limited education opportunities, and long-term social and psychological consequences.  

While acknowledging government efforts to curb this practice, child rights activist Bhuwan Ribhu emphasizes the need for stronger legal action, societal awareness, and political will. He highlights the importance of investing in education for girls, prosecuting all those involved in child marriages, and creating a child-centric community. Ribhu proposes the PICKET strategy, focusing on Policy, Investment, Convergence, Knowledge, Ecosystem, and Technology, as a roadmap to end child marriage in India and ultimately contribute to a global solution.

Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida announced his resignation as leader of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), citing declining popularity and ongoing scandals as key factors. Kishida's approval ratings have plummeted to record lows, and his attempts to address internal party issues and financial irregularities have been met with public criticism. 

He hopes his resignation will pave the way for a new LDP leader with a fresh image to unite the party and improve its standing with voters ahead of the next general election in 2025. Several potential candidates, including former defense minister Ishiba Shigeru and current digital minister Kono Taro, are vying for the leadership position. The race is expected to be competitive, with the winner becoming the next prime minister of Japan due to the LDP's majority in the Diet.

Despite the instability in South Asia, India is experiencing economic growth and presents a significant opportunity for the region. India's robust 7% growth rate and strategic reforms are attracting foreign investment, making it a prime destination for businesses compared to its struggling neighbors. 

China's infrastructure-heavy investment model has proven ineffective, leaving countries like Pakistan with unsustainable debt.  Meanwhile, other South Asian nations like Bangladesh and Nepal face economic and political challenges.   Continued political resistance to collaborating with India risks perpetuating poverty in the region. Ultimately, engaging with India's economic prowess is essential for South Asian prosperity.

The recent change in leadership in Bangladesh, following a student-led upheaval, has significant strategic implications for India and the region.  The political instability stems from rising dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's authoritarianism and economic decline. This situation marks a departure from the strong civil-military relations Bangladesh has seen since its independence. 
The article highlights the country's long history of military intervention in politics and the challenges of defining national identity, particularly in terms of secularism versus Islamism.  The instability in Bangladesh could impact India-Bangladesh relations, potentially jeopardizing the progress made in trade, connectivity, and defence cooperation. Moreover, a destabilized Bangladesh could weaken BIMSTEC and pose a broader security challenge to India, as it borders five Indian states.

India's initiatives include the Global South Centre of Excellence, the Global South Scholarship Programme, and the Global South Young Diplomats Forum, all aimed at strengthening South-South cooperation and building capacity. The summits seek to create  sustainable solutions and reduce dependence on external aid, promoting indigenous developmental models and leveraging India's digital public infrastructure expertise.

ISRO successfully launched its Small Satellite Launch Vehicle (SSLV) on its third and final development flight, marking the vehicle as fully operational. This launch is significant as it allows ISRO to capture the growing market for launching small satellites, a niche previously served by the larger and more expensive Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV).

### [Why India should worry about a Kamala Harris presidency](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-india-should-worry-about-a-kamala-harris-presidency-13805290.html)

A Harris presidency could significantly harm US-India relations, deviating from the bipartisan consensus that has characterized the relationship since 2001.  The author argues that Harris's potential foreign policy approach, influenced by the Democratic party's progressive wing and online activism, would prioritize Hinduphobia, denigration of Indian democracy, and Khalistan separatism, undermining the interests of Indian Americans who generally support strong US-India ties.  

The author contrasts Harris with Biden's administration, which has navigated sensitive issues with India diplomatically. They contend that Harris, unlike Biden, would be more susceptible to pressure from human rights groups and left-leaning bureaucrats, leading to a more adversarial relationship with India.   
  
A Harris presidency, according to the author, could result in the worst crises in US-India relations since the Clinton administration and the actions of Henry Kissinger.

The arrest of former Pakistani ISI chief Faiz Hameed signals a concerning trend within the Pakistani army.  Hameed, known for his role in various political interventions and alleged corruption, is now accused of treason, highlighting the increasing paranoia within military ranks. 

This move by the current Army Chief, Gen. Asim Munir, marks a departure from past norms by targeting his own officers. The arrest of Hameed is expected to trigger a domino effect, potentially involving other senior officials, including former Army Chief Qamar Bajwa. This internal strife within the army raises serious questions about its stability and governance. The army's reputation for discipline and integrity, once a cornerstone of its authority, appears to be eroding due to frequent military involvement in politics and endemic corruption. The situation presents a significant challenge for Pakistan's security and stability, and demands careful attention from India as it considers any future engagements with its volatile neighbour.

Although the recent change in leadership in Bangladesh, with the 'pro-India' Sheikh Hasina ousted, has led to some pessimism in India, a history of pragmatic diplomacy shows that engagement is key. The article uses the example of the Maldives, where anti-India sentiments initially led to tensions, ultimately followed by a turnaround and renewed cooperation.  

India's consistent support, including development assistance and debt relief, proved crucial in mitigating the Maldives' economic difficulties, leading to a shift in the political landscape. The author suggests that a similar pattern might emerge in Bangladesh, highlighting India's continued engagement with both the new government and members of the previous regime. 


The shared economic, security, and developmental interests between India and Bangladesh are undeniable, making sustained engagement vital for long-term regional stability and prosperity.

The article discusses the violent attack on RG Medical College and Hospital in Kolkata by a mob following the rape and murder of a trainee doctor. Eyewitness accounts and reports suggest the police remained largely inactive, with officers offering minimal resistance and even seeking refuge while the mob vandalized the premises. 

The article criticizes the state government's handling of the situation, alleging a cover-up of administrative lapses. The Chief Minister, Mamata Banerjee, has claimed that the perpetrators were BJP and DYFI workers, but the author questions her assertion. The Calcutta High Court has transferred the case to the CBI, given the lack of progress and concerns about evidence tampering.  The  author calls for accountability and transparency from the government, emphasizing the need to address the concerns of women who feel vulnerable and endangered in light of the horrific crime.

China's economic growth is slowing, raising concerns among policymakers and investors. Despite a 20-point plan to stabilize and boost the economy, growth in the second quarter of 2024 fell short of expectations.  

Several challenges contribute to this slowdown, including trade tensions, a debt crisis in the corporate sector, a cooling property market, and a struggling manufacturing sector.  Furthermore, China faces an aging population, the need for state-owned enterprise reform, and competition with the West in emerging technologies.

There are worries that China may fall into the middle-income trap, a situation where growth stalls preventing a country from reaching high-income status.  To avoid this, sustained growth rates of 6-7% are needed, making the current trend a serious concern for Chinese leaders who rely on economic prosperity for their legitimacy.

Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina resigned following mass protests sparked by the reinstatement of a quota system for government jobs. The protests, initially student-led, escalated into a nationwide movement against Hasina's government, exposing issues of corruption and authoritarianism. General Waker Uz Zaman, the Chief of Army Staff, declared a military takeover, released opposition leader Khalida Zia from house arrest, and appointed Nobel Laureate Muhammad Yunus as the head of an interim government. The interim government faces the challenge of restoring peace and preparing for new elections.  

The political landscape in Bangladesh is shifting, with potential geopolitical implications for neighboring countries like India and Pakistan.

In 1946, a mutiny within the Royal Indian Navy erupted in Bombay, fueled by poor treatment, working conditions, and the desire for independence.  Spreading to other bases across India, the mutiny received widespread support from the local population. The British, facing an unprecedented level of resistance from their own forces, realized the precariousness of their rule. 

The uprising, likened to the Indian Rebellion of 1857 by the British High Commissioner John Freeman, significantly hastened the British departure from India. Though some national leaders distanced themselves from the mutiny, its impact was undeniable, demonstrating the widespread discontent and solidifying the path towards independence. However, the potential for uniting the nation under a single movement for freedom was ultimately squandered.

The ongoing Israel-Hamas war in Gaza, now over ten months old, has escalated into regional conflicts involving Hezbollah, Iran-backed militias, and even Iran itself. 

Israel, emboldened by its technological superiority, has assassinated key Hamas and Hezbollah leaders, claiming to weaken their capabilities. This, however, has increased the risk of a wider war, potentially drawing in Iran and its proxies. The international community, including Israel's allies, have criticized Israel's actions, particularly the high civilian casualties in Gaza, and have accused Israel of potential genocide. 

While Israel believes its  integrations with Arab states would have marginalized extremist groups, the Palestinian conflict remains its biggest challenge.  The lack of peace and deep-seated trauma on both sides make finding a solution increasingly difficult.

The article discusses the rapid shift in public perception surrounding Kamala Harris, from being viewed as a liability to becoming a symbol of hope for democracy and liberalism. 

Despite low approval ratings and previous criticism, Harris is now praised by media outlets that once condemned her. The article attributes this shift to a carefully orchestrated narrative campaign, particularly in light of Donald Trump's presidency and the perceived threat he poses to the established order. 

Harris's perceived competence and her alignment with progressive figures like Bernie Sanders and Ilham Omar raise concerns about potential changes in U.S. foreign policy, particularly concerning India and Israel. 

The article concludes by highlighting the manipulation of narratives in elections, using Trump and the recent Indian elections as examples, and suggests that the world faces uncertain times ahead.

The ousting of Sheikh Hasina from power in Bangladesh following protests sparked by a quota system reinstatement has created a tense situation. Bangladesh's interim government, headed by Muhammed Yunus, has been met with violence and a backlash against minorities, particularly Hindus. 

The BNP and the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI), known for its links to Bangladesh's 1971 liberation war atrocities and its support for establishing an Islamic state, are seen as influential forces in this new political landscape.  India is closely monitoring the situation, concerned about  JeI's potential to destabilize the region and its ties to global jihadi organizations.  With potential for unrest and democratic backsliding, India faces the challenge of supporting democratic processes and protecting the interests of minorities in Bangladesh while navigating the evolving political dynamics.

The Pakistani military took the unprecedented step of arresting and charging former ISI chief Lt Gen Faiz Hameed with violating the Pakistan Army Act, both before and after his retirement. This action, initiated by the current Army Chief Gen Asim Munir, stems from a Supreme Court order regarding allegations of extortion against Hameed.

The timing of the arrest, shortly after Pakistan celebrated javelin thrower Arshad Nadeem's historic Olympic gold medal, highlights the internal power struggle within Pakistan.  Mushir argues that the arrest overshadows the national jubilation and reflects Pakistan's ongoing turmoil. He further connects the arrest to a broader pattern of military interference in attempts at peace with India, citing past instances under Prime Ministers Vajpayee and Modi.

### [Budget and after: Time to prioritise agriculture, health and education](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/budget-and-after-time-to-prioritise-agriculture-health-and-education-13804261.html)

To achieve the vision of Viksit Bharat, India needs to address the needs of those at the bottom of the economic pyramid. Despite being the fifth largest economy, India's per capita income is low and the benefits of growth are unequally distributed. 

Agriculture, employing a large portion of the population, requires significant attention. Stagnant growth in the sector necessitates investment in technology, infrastructure, R&D, and value addition through food processing.  Subsidies and social safety nets, while crucial, should be complemented by initiatives that empower farmers and increase their incomes.   

Focusing on agriculture, health, and education as key priorities will benefit the majority of the population and drive inclusive growth, creating a stronger foundation for sustainable progress.

### [How regime change in Bangladesh is an immediate setback for India in the neighbourhood](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-regime-change-in-bangladesh-is-an-immediate-setback-for-india-in-the-neighbourhood-13804241.html)

Following the ousting of Sheikh Hasina's government by a student-led movement, an interim government led by Muhammed Yunus has taken charge. While Yunus enjoys international recognition for his work with Grameen Bank, he is politically aligned against Hasina, facing charges of violating labour laws.

Concerns for India center around restoring stability, safeguarding the Hindu minority now vulnerable to anti-Indian and Islamic elements, and addressing the possibility of closer relations between Bangladesh and China. 

China's growing influence in Bangladesh, already evident through the Belt and Road Initiative and military partnerships, is a cause for concern for India.  The US has been critical of Hasina's government on democratic grounds, a stance that differs from India's, and has not explicitly addressed the security of minorities in Bangladesh. This divergence in approach between the US and India regarding Bangladesh highlights a potential strategic disconnect.

### [Human rights debacle in Britain: West must end double standard](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/human-rights-debacle-in-britain-west-must-end-double-standard-13804133.html)

This article critiques the West's double standard on human rights. It argues that while Western media and governments are quick to condemn human rights abuses in the Global South, they are silent or dismissive when similar issues occur within their own borders or allies.  

The article cites examples of anti-immigrant riots in the UK, US and Canadian actions in Belarus and Gaza as evidence of this hypocrisy. It also points to reports by Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International detailing human rights violations within the UK, US and Canada, emphasizing disregard for these reports by respective governments.  The author calls for greater vocalization of these issues by the Global South to expose this hypocrisy and urge Western powers to adopt consistent human rights standards.

The recent political turmoil in Bangladesh, triggered by the ousting of Sheikh Hasina, presents a complex geopolitical challenge for India.  

Bangladesh's importance to India stems from its strategic location, cultural ties, and shared interests. However, the vacuum created by Hasina's exit risks influencing regional stability and could potentially see a rise in radical Islamist activities. 

Both China and the US are vying for influence in Bangladesh, presenting India with a strategic balancing act. While China offers economic and military incentives, India must leverage its historical ties and geographical proximity to maintain a positive relationship.  

India must engage diplomatically with the interim government in Bangladesh, emphasizing shared concerns regarding China, terrorism, and minority rights. Additionally, ensuring the safety of Indian citizens and Hindus in Bangladesh, monitoring borders, and continuing to cooperate on regional security initiatives are paramount.

Ahead of his visit to Kyiv, Prime Minister Modi's trip to Ukraine is viewed as a crucial step in navigating a shifting global order.  The visit comes amid heightened global tensions following Russia's invasion of Ukraine and a growing strategic alliance between Russia and China. India seeks to maintain strategic autonomy, balancing its relationships with both the US-led West and the China-Russia bloc.  

Recent engagements between India and China, including conciliatory statements on border issues and a tentative thaw in economic ties, suggest a potential for greater cooperation.  This realignment could be driven by China's need to find new markets and India's emergence as a significant economic power. Modi's meeting with Zelenskyy will likely focus on addressing the ongoing conflict and India's role as a potential mediator within the fractured world order.

Kamala Harris's political ascent has been rapid, propelled by a combination of opportunity and shrewd maneuvering. Since being named Biden's running mate, she rose to the candidacy with remarkable energy and organization, uniting the Democratic party behind her.  

She has successfully challenged Donald Trump's dominance in polls and mobilized a significant financial resource for her campaign. Harris's message focuses on safeguarding democracy and advocating for the middle class, women's rights, and gun safety. Despite facing a formidable opponent in Trump, her campaign approach, coupled with his own struggles, has shifted the tide of the 2024 election race.

The article argues that India's Waqf Act, designed to protect Muslim religious and charitable endowments, is discriminatory and outdated. 

The author contends that the Act, established after Independence, has been progressively amended to favor Waqf Boards and grant them unfettered power over waqf properties, even those claimed by non-Muslims. 

They highlight provisions that allow the Waqf Board to determine if property is waqf, are exempt from statutes of limitations, and allow it to encompass non-Muslim dedications. The author criticizes the Muslim-dominated composition of these Boards and contrasts their autonomy with state oversight of Hindu temples.  

The article concludes by calling for the amendment of the Waqf Act, arguing that its current form undermines secularism and promotes an "apartheid" system against the majority population.

### [How Bangladesh crisis resembles closely with West-orchestrated ‘colour revolutions’ and Arab Spring](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-bangladesh-crisis-resembles-closely-with-west-orchestrated-colour-revolutions-and-arab-spring-13803791.html)

The recent coup in Bangladesh, orchestrated by the military with support from radical Islamist parties like Jamaat-e-Islami (JeI) has raised concerns about the future of democracy in the country. The ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who oversaw significant socio-economic progress,  paves the way for an unstable political landscape. This coup, reminiscent of "colour revolutions" in Eurasia and the Arab Spring, could lead to the rise of a theocratic state.

The interim government, led by Muhammad Yunus, is likely to face immense challenges as the powerful BNP, JeI, and the military seek dominance.  Khaleda Zia, the BNP leader, is expected to resist Yunus's authority, further complicating the situation. The coup is also a major threat to Bangladesh's minority Hindu population, who have faced persecution in the past. The fragile peace and stability of Bangladesh hang in the balance as the nation navigates this turbulent political transition.

Hindus in Bangladesh face chronic fear and insecurity due to prevalent violence and discrimination.  Since 1947, their population has significantly dwindled, now standing at approximately 8%. 

They are routinely targeted during religious celebrations like Durga Puja, with unfounded rumors often leading to attacks on temples and communities, resulting in deaths, and horrific acts of sexual violence against women. The government's response to these atrocities is often inadequate, perpetuating a cycle of impunity for the perpetrators. 

This systematic persecution, met by deafening silence from the international community, threatens the very fabric of Bangladeshi society. Urgent action is required to protect the Hindu community and ensure their safety and dignity.

Hamas, despite the substantial damage inflicted by the Israeli operation, remains a potent force. Its recruitment efforts are bolstered by Israel's actions, with anger and frustration among Gazans providing fertile ground for radicalization.  Hamas's transition to guerrilla tactics, utilizing its intricate tunnel network and urban knowledge, presents a significant challenge for the IDF, who are unaccustomed to prolonged urban warfare. 

The organization's 'beehive' leadership structure ensures continuity even amidst losses. Although militarily weakened, Hamas's resilience stems from its deep roots in the Palestinian population, which view them as defenders against Israeli occupation. Hamas's success, however, comes at a high cost for the Palestinian people, who are trapped in a cycle of violence and suffering.

President Droupadi Murmu's state visit to Timor-Leste, a first for an Indian head of state, signifies growing strategic importance for India.  Timor-Leste recently became an ASEAN observer and aims to be a full member soon, making it a key player in India's Act East Policy. 

India intends to open a resident mission in Dili, reciprocating Timor-Leste's likely future mission in New Delhi. The visit saw cultural and diplomatic exchanges, including a high-level welcome, the bestowal of Timor-Leste's highest honor on President Murmu, and a televised interview on President Horta's popular show.  

Three Memorandums of Understanding were signed, focusing on cultural cooperation, visa-free access for diplomats, and broadcasting collaboration.  The visit opens doors for enhanced development cooperation through ASEAN-India funds and reinforces the potential for economic partnerships, particularly in sectors like education and healthcare.

Bangladesh is going through a major political shift following the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina.  Noebel laureate Muhammad Yunus leads an interim government while efforts are made to restore order and prepare for new elections.  

However, the rise of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami party, which has ties to militancy, poses a threat to Bangladesh's secular foundation and India's security interests. The party's resurgence could lead to an increase in anti-India sentiment, cross-border terrorism, and instability in the region. Additionally, the growing influence of China and Pakistan in Bangladesh complicates the situation further, challenging India's regional standing.

AI's growing integration into criminal activities presents a significant threat. Deepfakes enable disinformation, while AI-powered phishing and social engineering attacks are increasingly sophisticated.  Cybercriminals use AI to identify vulnerabilities and launch targeted attacks, and AI-driven malware adapts rapidly to evade detection.  

The autonomous nature of AI complicates traditional liability models, making it challenging to assign responsibility for crimes involving artificial agents.  

Addressing this challenge requires a multifaceted approach: international cooperation to establish AI development norms, a revised legal framework that considers AI's unique characteristics, investments in AI for detecting and mitigating criminal AI, and fostering an ethical AI culture.

The article argues against an uncritical acceptance of student protesters as inherently positive forces.  While acknowledging their historical heroism, it cites examples of student movements that have been morally corrupt, naive, or even dangerous.  

The author points to instances like the Students for a Democratic Society in the 1960s, the Red Brigades in Italy, and  certain student movements in India,  to illustrate how student activism can be manipulated by external forces or result in harmful actions.  The article concludes by emphasizing the need to critically evaluate student protests rather than blindly assuming their noble intentions.

Recent violence and turmoil in Bangladesh have highlighted the dire situation for the Hindu minority.  The exodus of Sheikh Hasina and the rise of the Islamist Jamaat-e-Islami, which has strong historical ties to Pakistan and anti-Bangladesh sentiments, have led to targeted attacks on Hindus. 

The events in Bangladesh shatter the myth of Bengali nationalism as a unifying force, exposing the fragility of cultural and linguistic unity in the face of religious extremism. This underscores the global persecution of Hindus, who have been increasingly marginalized and targeted for their faith. The Citizenship Amendment Act (CAA) in India, which offers refuge to persecuted minorities, becomes even more relevant in light of these events.

The  Rod Marathas are a community based in Haryana, with origins tracing back to the aftermath of the Battle of Panipat in 1761.  After the Maratha defeat,  a few hundred soldiers and non-combatants managed to escape and settled in the region, giving rise to this distinct community. 

Today, the Rod Marathas share cultural similarities with their namesake from Maharashtra, including language, rituals, and even architectural styles. 

Their history connects them to the now peaceful region where a landmark memorial, the Kala Aam, commemorates the loss of Maratha commander Sadashiv Rao Bhau.  While Neeraj Chopra’s connection to the community has been debated, the story of the Rod Marathas exemplifies how historical events can lead to the creation of new communities in unexpected locations.

The article discusses the geopolitical tensions surrounding Bangladesh, particularly concerning the recent political upheaval and China's growing influence.  

After the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, who maintained a balanced relationship with both India and China, there is concern about Bangladesh becoming more aligned with China. China has invested heavily in Bangladesh's infrastructure and military, supplying advanced weapons systems and building strategic facilities. This has raised concerns in India, especially as Baladiganag, located near Bangladesh, had close ties with China and could potentially  threaten India's security.

The US has also been eyeing Bangladesh for potential military bases, but its efforts were met with resistance from Hasina. 

  The article concludes by urging India to remain proactive in its engagement with Bangladesh, strengthening bilateral ties, and promoting regional cooperation to counter China's growing influence in the Bay of Bengal region.

This article examines the geopolitical implications of the US and Russia supplying arms to opposing sides in the Middle East. The US strongly backs Israel with substantial military aid, including advanced weaponry like F-35 fighter jets and missile defence systems, aiming to counter Iran's influence and secure its ally's security. Conversely, Russia arms countries opposed to US interests, like Iran, Syria, and Hezbollah, providing sophisticated weaponry such as the S-400 air defence system. This arms race increases regional instability and risks escalating conflicts, as demonstrated by the perpetual tension between Israel and Iran.

The article argues that this rivalry reflects a broader global power struggle between the US and Russia, extending beyond the Middle East. This competition intensifies the danger of misunderstanding and escalation, raising concerns for global peace and stability.  It concludes by emphasizing the need for the international community to promote dialogue and cooperation to prevent further destabilization.

The resignation of Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, following widespread protests, creates uncertainty for Indo-Bangla relations.  Historically close, the countries have enjoyed cooperation in various sectors, including trade, security, and regional connectivity.  However, the emergence of a potentially US-leaning government necessitates careful navigation by India. 

Ensuring the continuity of economic partnerships, security cooperation, and regional connectivity projects will be crucial. India must engage proactively with the new government, emphasizing stability and mutual interests while encouraging a balanced foreign policy for Bangladesh. The future of the relationship hinges on navigating this transition with foresight and a shared vision for regional prosperity.

Boeing's Starliner spacecraft, carrying astronauts Sunita Williams and Barry Wilmore, experienced multiple delays and technical issues since its launch in June.  Initially intended for a week-long mission to the International Space Station (ISS), the return date has been pushed back multiple times due to helium leaks and software glitches.

The article critiques the  "International Day of the World's Indigenous Peoples" (IDWIP), arguing that its celebration in India is inappropriate and carries a hidden agenda.  

The author contends that the date, August 9,  is insensitive as it marks a historical event of genocide against indigenous peoples by European powers. While acknowledging the plight of indigenous populations globally, the author emphasizes that India's own history doesn't align with the Western narrative of indigenous people as solely victims.  

The article suggests celebrating the contributions of prominent tribal figures in India's history instead. It concludes by highlighting that IDWIP represents Western atonement for past atrocities, while "Janjatiya Gaurav Divas" (Tribal Pride Day) in India celebrates the indigenous spirit inherent in all Indians.

Vietnam and the Philippines recently conducted their first joint coast guard exercises in Manila Bay, a significant move against growing Chinese assertiveness in the South China Sea. The drills, which included search and rescue, fire control, and friendly sports competitions, highlight the two nations'  shared concerns over Beijing's expansionist ambitions in the region. 

Despite their own overlapping territorial claims in the South China Sea, both Vietnam and the Philippines are increasingly cooperating to counter Chinese actions. This comes after a recent violent confrontation between Chinese and Philippine coast guards in the Philippine-controlled waters of Second Thomas Shoal. 


The growing alignment between Vietnam, the Philippines, and the United States, through initiatives like the “Squad” security arrangement, has heightened tensions with China, which views these actions as a direct challenge to its regional influence.

Sheikh Hasina's departure from Bangladesh following her resignation has left the Awami League party in a precarious situation, raising questions about its future.  Hissitianing echoes previous dynastic monarch removals  Hasina's sudden exit, after a resounding election victory just eight months prior, contrasts sharply with her father, Sheikh Mujibur Rehman, who was assassinated during a coup.  

The Bangladesh Army facilitated Hasina's escape, opting for a less disruptive transition compared to a full-fledged coup. This move appears to align with the student-led movement demanding democracy and free elections, reminiscent of the 1990 downfall of General H.M. Ershad.

However, Hasina's leadership has been criticized for its autocratic tendencies and failure to secure the Awami League's future. Her ouster is likely to empower forces opposed to cultural syncretism and India, potentially impacting the delicate Indo-Bangladesh relationship.

Bangladesh's political history has been turbulent, marked by coups, violence, and political instability. The recent ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina by mass student protests has raised concerns about an indefinite civil war. 

Deep-seated mistrust between the two major political parties, the Awami League and the Bangladesh Nationalist Party, fuels the conflict. The military's involvement in politics is another significant factor, with generals frequently seizing power.  The rise of student power, coupled with increasing Islamic radicalization, adds to the complexity.  Foreign powers, such as Pakistan, may also exploit the situation to their advantage.

With an aging and ailing Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus leading the interim government, there are doubts about his ability to manage the prevailing chaos. Bangladesh faces a period of internal upheaval with potentially serious consequences for neighboring India.

A series of Israeli assassinations targeting Iranian proxy commanders in Lebanon, Syria, and potentially Qatar has heightened tensions in the Middle East. While Israel maintains silence, Iran accuses Israel's Mossad of being behind the killings, viewing it as a serious breach of security and a test to its regional influence.  

These attacks, believed to be part of a more calculated strategy by Israel, have ramifications for both Israelis and Iranians. Israel  experiences a boost in military morale and a political lifeline for Netanyahu, but faces potential Iranian retaliation. Iran, facing embarrassment and pressure to respond, is evaluating its options, including limited strikes, covert operations, or even terrorism.

The international community, particularly the US, is engaged in a delicate balancing act, providing Israel with military support while trying to contain the situation and prevent further escalation.

The article discusses  the parallels between Sikh extremism and Islamic extremism, drawing comparisons to the Air India 1985 bombing and the rise of Al Qaeda. 

The author argues that, similar to how Islamist extremists exploited  religious organizations and charities for their agenda, pro-Khalistan activists are hijacking peaceful Sikh communities.

It concludes that unlike  the US's post-9/11 understanding of Islamist extremism,  Sikh extremism remains largely unnoticed, urging a reevaluation of this growing threat and a focus on supporting authentic Sikh communities.

The article discusses the escalating tensions in the Middle East following a series of assassinations targeting key figures in Iran-supported groups.  These incidents, including the assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh and Hezbollah commander Fuad Shukr, have led to a heightened risk of a regional war. 

Iran, vowing revenge, possesses a formidable arsenal, including ballistic missiles, drones, and proxies like Hezbollah and the Houthis. 

Hezbollah has a vast cache of rockets and anti-tank missiles, while the Houthis specialize in  ballistic and cruise missiles, and drones. 

Hamas, while lacking conventional forces, relies on guerrilla tactics and a smaller arsenal of rockets. Israel, meanwhile, is relying on its robust air defenses to counter potential attacks. The situation remains precarious, with the possibility of a full-blown regional conflict looming large.

### [Bangladesh is in the throes of Islamist pogrom against minority Hindus, and our liberals are busy obfuscating reality](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-is-in-the-throes-of-islamist-pogrom-against-minority-hindus-and-our-liberals-are-busy-obfuscating-reality-13802267.html)

The student-led movement in Bangladesh, which led to the ousting of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, has descended into violence and persecution of the Hindu minority. Extremist Islamist groups, such as Jamaat-e-Islami, have capitalized on the chaos, targeting Hindu homes, businesses, and temples.  

Videos and testimonies depict horrific scenes of violence, including lynchings and desecration of religious sites. Despite these alarming reports, some Indian liberals are downplaying the situation, labeling it as "exaggerated" or an "attempt by Hindu right-wing" to create a narrative. 

The present crisis has historical roots, as Hindus were historically targeted during the Bangladesh liberation war, with widespread violence and sexual attacks documented. Though the ouster of Hasina brought initial celebrations, the subsequent violence and targeting of Hindus reveals a deeper, more sinister agenda driven by Islamist extremists who have seized the opportunity to unleash their hatred and create a climate of fear for the Hindu community.  

This recent violence against Hindus in Bangladesh raises serious concerns about the safety and security of the minority population and highlights the urgent need for international intervention to protect their rights.

Kamala Harris selected Tim Walz as her running mate after evaluating several potential candidates. Walz, a two-term Minnesota governor and former congressman, offers experience, political savvy, and a center-of-the-road approach that contrasts with Harris's progressive stance. His selection aims to balance the ticket both geographically and ideologically, attracting white working-class voters and providing counterpoint to Donald Trump and his running mate, J.D. Vance. Walz's military service and Midwestern demeanor are seen as assets, while potential vulnerabilities regarding his record on issues like immigration and law enforcement may be exploited by the Republican campaign.

### [Bangladesh crisis: A play of invisible Chinese hand?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bangladesh-crisis-a-play-of-invisible-chinese-hand-13802059.html)

The article argues that China may be orchestrating a coup in Bangladesh against Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina due to her stance against Islamic extremism and her pro-India leanings. 

The author cites China's increasing engagement with Islamic extremist groups globally, including Pakistan-sponsored terrorists, Hamas, and the Taliban, as evidence of its shifting strategy. This engagement, he suggests, is fueled by an aim to counter India and secure geopolitical advantage, potentially leading to instability in the region.  

The article concludes that China's alliance with Islamic extremist groups could backfire, as these groups often pursue their own interests regardless of their backers.

India is deeply intertwined with Bangladesh's internal affairs due to their shared border, religious connections, and water resources. India's support for Sheikh Hasina's leadership, despite growing international pressure and domestic challenges, arose from concerns about cross-border infiltration and the potential for instability.  The recent elections, marred by opposition boycotts and allegations of authoritarianism, have raised questions about India's approach. The article suggests potential avenues India could have explored, such as encouraging a more inclusive political landscape in Bangladesh. It also draws parallels with the 1975 political turmoil in India under Indira Gandhi, highlighting the potential for regional instability to have repercussions for India.

### [From hope to despair: Testing time for democracy in Bangladesh](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/from-hope-to-despair-testing-time-for-democracy-in-bangladesh-13801957.html)

Sheikh Hasina, the Prime Minister of Bangladesh, resigned and fled to India amidst violent student protests. Initially sparked by quota demands in government jobs, the protests escalated, with the backing of Jamaat-e-Islami Bangladesh and its student wing, Islami Chhatra Shibir. These groups have a history of anti-Awami League sentiments and have been implicated in war crimes during Bangladesh's liberation in 1971.  

The violence resulted in numerous deaths, attacks on Hindu communities, and damage to public and private property.  The Bangladeshi Army intervened, establishing an interim government and raising concerns about a potential return to military rule.  The resurfacing of the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), with the release of jailed leader Khaleda Zia, further complicates the political landscape, creating a potential power struggle between the Army and Jamaat-BNP. 

The situation paints a worrying picture for Bangladesh's future, with democratic processes seemingly compromised and the rise of extremist elements posing a grave threat to stability.

A recent upheaval in Bangladesh has resulted in the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Protests, initially sparked by a court ruling on quotas for the offspring of freedom fighters, escalated into widespread violence and demonstrations demanding Hasina's removal. 

Factors contributing to the unrest include allegations of government corruption, suppression of media freedom, enforced disappearances, and a controversial Digital Security Act.  The army, observing growing public discontent and after a plea from retired officers, intervened to ensure stability, ultimately giving Hasina an ultimatum to resign. 

The situation has attracted international attention, with the US and EU expressing their positions on the developments.  India faces potential implications from the instability,  including a possible influx of refugees and the need to navigate its relationships with various Bangladeshi political forces.

The article discusses the United States' removal of Sheikh Hasina as Prime Minister of Bangladesh, arguing this decision plays into the hands of Pakistan and China.  The author criticizes the US's hypocritical stance on democracy, citing similar interference in the past.

The removal of Hasina, who the author believes provided stability and protected minorities, is framed as a CIA-led "revolution" that benefits chaotic outcomes and challenges India's security. 

The author sees the US move as a miscalculation, ultimately strengthening China's influence in the region and warns of potential similar machinations against India.

### [India in a hostile neighbourhood: Way ahead for New Delhi](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/india-in-a-hostile-neighbourhood-way-ahead-for-new-delhi-13801446.html)

The fall of Sheikh Hasina's government in Bangladesh raises concerns about India's security. The opposition groups, Jamaat-e-Islami and Bangladesh National Party (BNP), are anti-secular and potentially aligned with Pakistan and possibly the US Deep State. These groups aim to establish an Islamic identity in Bangladesh, contrasting with its secular foundation.  

The US involvement, while seemingly promoting "democracy," could be driven by strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific region, aiming to counter China and exert pressure on India.


India faces the prospect of hostile neighbours on all sides. To counteract this, it should strengthen ties with Southeast Asia,  Indo-Pacific powers, and the Middle East, leveraging its historical strengths in trade, military power, and cultural influence to secure its position and promote stability in the region.

### [Why Bangladesh crisis demands a pragmatic approach from Mamata Banerjee](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-bangladesh-crisis-demands-a-pragmatic-approach-from-mamata-banerjee-13801431.html)

The recent turmoil in Bangladesh has created a potential refugee crisis in West Bengal, India.  West Bengal, with its long history of hosting refugees, faces significant demographic, economic, and social challenges. The influx could strain public services, exacerbate unemployment, and potentially heighten religious tensions.  While Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee's stance of welcoming refugees is commendable, it is argued that this approach is flawed and potentially risky. Critics contend that it ignores the potential strain on resources and security, and could lead to unintended consequences.

A more balanced approach, they suggest, requires careful planning, collaboration with the central government and international organizations, and measures to ensure the well-being of both refugees and the local population.

Political unrest in Bangladesh culminated in the resignation of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. Protests, initially sparked by a High Court decision reinstating a quota system for government jobs, escalated into a nationwide crisis exposing economic instability, corruption, and a pattern of government crackdowns. 

The unrest has raised concerns in India, as Hasina's government was considered a close ally. Her departure presents an opportunity for China, which has faced a strained relationship with Bangladeshi leadership. While the unrest appears to have organic roots, suspicions remain about potential foreign influence, particularly from China, seeking to advance its strategic interests in the region.  India now requires a cautious approach to navigate this shift in Bangladesh's political landscape and develop a contingency plan.

The article discusses a letter signed by prominent Indian citizens urging the government to halt arms exports to Israel due to the ongoing conflict with Hamas. The author argues that this move would be detrimental to India's burgeoning defense manufacturing sector, which has seen significant growth in recent years.  

India's collaboration with Israel in defense technology is highlighted as a valuable asset in bolstering India's military capabilities. The author criticizes the signatories of the letter for selectively applying moral and humanitarian concerns while neglecting similar issues in other conflicts, particularly those involving China and Pakistan.  She concludes that prioritizing national interest and commercial partnerships is crucial for India's defense aspirations.

Darrin McMahon's book "Equality" explores the complex and multifaceted nature of equality throughout history.  

While universally desired, the concept of equality has been subject to reinterpretation and exclusion across diverse cultures, religions, and political ideologies. From ancient societies to modern thought, equality has been both a guiding principle and a tool of differentiation. 

McMahon highlights the inherent tension between the human capacity for cooperation and the tendency towards hierarchy and power.  He argues that achieving and sustaining equality requires constant vigilance against regressive systems of inequality.

The article discusses India's role within the Quad (Quadrilateral Security Dialogue) and its evolving relationship with China. 

Recent speculation regarding a potential China-India détente, fueled by high-level diplomatic meetings, has led to questions about India's commitment to Quad. The article argues that despite India's economic considerations regarding China, such as  concerns over a trade deficit and potential for increased Chinese FDI, its geopolitical strategy remains focused on balancing China's influence.

India's approach to Quad is described as broader than a mere security framework, encompassing technological collaboration, supply chain resilience, and humanitatian assistance.  The article emphasizes India's strengthening security ties with Southeast Asian nations to counter China's assertiveness in the South China Sea, citing specific examples like arms deals with Vietnam, joint exercises with the Philippines, and increased engagement with Indonesia and other ASEAN members.

Ultimately, the article argues that India's strategy in the Indo-Pacific is multi-faceted, aiming to deter Chinese aggression through a combination of bilateral, plurilateral, and multilateral engagements. While acknowledging Quad's evolving role, the author emphasizes that India maintains its independence and avoids becoming entangled in a rigid security alliance.

The assassination of Ismail Haniyeh poses a significant challenge for Iran.  The regime feels pressured to respond to protect its stability and influence in the region.  However, Iran is constrained by economic difficulties and the risk of a full-scale war with Israel and potentially the US.  A direct confrontation would be too costly, particularly given the threat to Iran's nuclear program.

Instead, Iran is likely to increase support for its proxies in Lebanon and other areas through actions like missile strikes.  The situation remains tense, with miscalculations by either Iran or Israel potentially escalating the conflict.

The article argues that Tibet, with its history of sovereignty stretching back to the 7th century, has been unjustly occupied by China since 1950-51.  It contends that China's expansionist policies threaten India's security and points to recent US actions supporting Tibetan autonomy as aligning with India's interests.  
The author proposes several steps India should take, including  establishing diplomatic relations with the Tibetan government-in-exile, supporting other oppressed groups within China, and pushing for international recognition of Tibet's sovereignty.  They maintain that supporting Tibet is essential for securing India's national interest.

Political instability, labeled as "chienlit" by Charles de Gaulle, has gripped France as President Emmanuel Macron dissolved the National Assembly and called for snap elections shortly before the 2024 Summer Olympics. 

The inconclusive elections, resulting in a fragmented political landscape, have added to the already tense situation. 

Despite this internal turmoil, the Olympics proceeded, witnessing both praise for its innovative opening ceremony featuring female icons, and criticism for a controversial tableau portraying Leonardo da Vinci's "The Last Supper" with drag queens. 

Amidst the political maneuvering of Macron seeking a consensual Prime Minister, the Games continue, serving as a platform for international unity despite the backdrop of national uncertainty.

This article explores the complex history and present-day challenges of Mewat, a region in northwestern India encompassing parts of Haryana and Rajasthan.  

Historically, the Meos, the region's inhabitants, were known for banditry and resistance to the Delhi Sultanate.  After forced conversion to Islam by Sultan Balban, the Meos continued to struggle with lawlessness despite a visible Islamic presence in the region.

The article examines how the region's heritage blends both Islamic and Hindu influences, evident in architectural styles and local narratives. Today, Mewat faces socio-economic problems, including low literacy rates, poverty, and high crime, which is attributed, in part, to the Tablighi Jamaat's influence.

Despite these challenges, the author notes a glimmer of hope, pointing to a recent religious procession in Nuh that was met with peaceful greetings, suggesting a potential for progress and unity in the future.

It highlights the devastating human and economic costs of the conflict and criticizes the West's military aid to Ukraine, arguing that it prolongs the war. 

The author also reveals a potential peace deal that could have ended the conflict within 100 days but was allegedly scuttled by the US and UK. He questions the purpose of Modi's visit, given India’s historical ties with Russia and Ukraine’s criticism of India's stance on the war.  

The article concludes by expressing doubt about the visit yielding concrete results and urging readers to observe the unfolding events.

The World Development Report 2024 highlights the "middle-income trap," where countries face stunted growth after reaching a certain level of income.  The report warns that 108 middle-income countries, including India, face unique challenges in escaping this trap.  It suggests a "3i" strategy: investments, infusion of technology, and innovation. While India might benefit from the initial "2i"s, it's urged to prioritize innovation and research & development, leveraging its  demographic dividend and human capital.  Addressing socio-economic inequalities is crucial to ensure inclusive growth and achieve the goal of "Vikisit Bharat" by 2047.

This article analyzes the evolution of Israeli warfare strategies since its founding. It highlights Israel's early victories in conflicts against Arab nations, attributing them to strategic military prowess. However, the author argues that Israel's post-1973 confrontations with Iranian proxies, particularly Hezbollah and Hamas, marked a shift towards a "forever in war" mentality characterized by terrorism.

The author asserts that the IDF's past successes are no longer translating into decisive victories, exemplified by the current conflict. This, coupled with Israel's exclusive reliance on military force over fostering non-partisan relations within opposing societies, has perpetuated the conflict. The author contrasts this with India's approach to hybrid warfare, emphasizing a more pragmatic and conflict-ending strategy.

The article examines Pakistan's repeated history of military misadventures against India, focusing on the Kargil War of 1999. It argues that this pattern stems from Pakistani leaders seeking to bolster their political standing through appeals to national pride and a perception of Indian threat. 

The author highlights how Pakistani leaders, including Ayub Khan, Bhutto, Yahya Khan, and Musharraf, capitalized on anti-India sentiment to justify wars, ultimately leading to their downfall. The Kargil War, in particular, is depicted as a strategic miscalculation that underscored Pakistan's conventional military weakness against India.  The author concludes by stating that each war waged by a Pakistani premier against India has resulted in their political demise.

India faces a significant youth unemployment crisis, with estimates varying widely due to data limitations. While the government highlights job creation, surveys by organizations like CMIE paint a contrasting picture, revealing high unemployment rates, particularly among educated youth. Young workers often find themselves in the informal sector with poor-quality jobs, facing challenges like low wages and inadequate working conditions. 

Addressing this issue requires coordinated efforts. The government should consolidate existing skill development and employment schemes under a single umbrella at the district level, providing a comprehensive support system for youth. Initiatives like the Youth Guarantee program implemented in the EU serve as successful models for empowering youth through education, training, and employment opportunities.

India's "Neighbourhood First" policy faces challenges due to China's growing influence in the Indian Ocean region. 

China's naval presence, infrastructure projects like the Belt and Road Initiative, and economic dependencies are shaping the region in a way that could undermine India's interests. While India has focused on building trust and capacity-building with its maritime neighbors, it needs to move faster and be more effective in its approach. China's methods, while arguably more efficient, often involve debt-trap diplomacy and long-term dependencies.  India's need to rewrite "The Hare and the Tortoise" fable,  means that it must act more decisively and deliver tangible results to counter China's growing influence.

Ismail Haniyeh, the head of Hamas's political bureau, was killed in a strike in Iran. This follows a pattern of Israeli targeted killings of Hamas leaders, including military figures like Mohammed Deif and Marwan Issa.  

Despite the ongoing Israeli assassinations, Hamas has demonstrated resilience, replenishing its leadership with successors. Khaled Mashal, a former Hamas leader, is considered a likely candidate to replace Haniyeh.

Hamas's structure, characterized by a "beehive" like leadership, enables it to withstand the loss of key figures. Even with the elimination of top leaders, new individuals step in, perpetuating the organization's operations and goals.

Israel is employing a strategy of total confrontation against its enemies, exemplified by recent targeted assassinations of high-ranking Hezbollah and Hamas officials. 

These precision strikes demonstrate Israel's ability to strike anywhere, sending a clear message of deterrence. With Hamas momentarily weakened, Israel is focusing on Hezbollah, considering a land invasion to cripple its military capability. This aggressive posture, driven by both security concerns and Netanyahu's political interests, aims to solidify his power base. However, this strategy risks escalating the conflict, particularly if provoked by Iran,  leading to a wider and more devastating war. Israel's aggressive actions highlight the need for a balanced approach that combines military strength with strategic foresight to avoid unintended consequences.

Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas's political bureau, was assassinated in Tehran. While Israel celebrated the killing, Hamas vowed revenge and declared open war to liberate Jerusalem. Haniyeh was a key negotiator in ceasefire talks with Israel, and his death is seen as a setback for the fragile peace efforts. 

Hamas is expected to retaliate, potentially leading to further escalation in the already tense region.  International concern surrounds the potential for a larger conflict, which could have global ramifications. The assassination raises questions about Israel's broader strategy, and its impact on the future of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict remains unclear.

The US, Japan, and South Korea have formalized their trilateral security cooperation with a historic agreement. This comes amidst growing concerns regarding North Korea's nuclear and missile program, the rising tensions with China, and the ever-present security challenges in the Indo-Pacific region. The agreement, known as the Trilateral Security Cooperation Framework (TSCF), aims to enhance cooperation in areas such as intelligence sharing, joint exercises, and defense technology exchange. This move signifies a deepening of ties between the three countries, seeking to  bolster their collective security and deter aggression from North Korea and China.  

The agreement follows several high-level summits and the resumption of defense exchanges between Japan and South Korea, overcoming past historical tensions. The US sees this strengthened trilateral relationship as crucial to its strategic interests in the Indo-Pacific, prompting  the realignment of its military forces in Japan to better address regional challenges.  The pact also highlights a shared concern about China's assertiveness in the region, as the three nations reiterate their opposition to any unilateral attempts to change the status quo.

Recent diplomatic exchanges between India and China highlight the ongoing border dispute and differing views on how to resolve it. Despite Chinese assurances of progress, India remains vigilant due to recent actions like the construction of a bridge near the Line of Actual Control (LAC).  

China's historical approach to border settlements, prioritizing its strategic and economic interests, coupled with its evolving security doctrines, suggests a complex calculation in its dealings with India.  China views India's growing ties with the US as a potential threat, and fears India could exploit the situation to advance its own territorial claims. Additionally, a potential conflict in the East and South China Seas could see India playing a crucial role, potentially blocking China's sea lines of communication. 

India must continue its firm stance and remain vigilant against Chinese misadventures, ensuring that any perceived progress does not become a new status quo.

### [Why US policies fail to resonate with Arab public opinion](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-us-policies-fail-to-resonate-with-arab-public-opinion-13799262.html)

The US's approach to West Asia has been marked by skepticism and caution, leading to strained relations with the Arab world. Despite substantial aid and strong defense ties, the US struggles to gain popular support due to its alignment with Israel and perceived failure to address regional grievances. The Iraq War and interventions in the region have further fueled anti-American sentiment. 

US strategic objectives in West Asia have often been unclear and its inability to adapt to changing dynamics, particularly the rise of Iran, presents a significant challenge. The US has also been criticized for double standards regarding human rights, which exacerbates regional hostility. 

Efforts by the US to maintain its influence are complicated by inconsistencies in foreign policy, a lack of understanding of regional sensitivities, and the growing attractiveness of alternative partners like China.

### [Why India needs to balance security concerns with neighbours’ sovereign considerations](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-india-needs-to-balance-security-concerns-with-neighbours-sovereign-considerations-13798861.html)

This article analyzes India's approach to its neighborhood and the expectations it places on its neighbors regarding security concerns, particularly those related to China.  

The author argues that India often expects its neighbors to share its anxieties about China and act accordingly, even when those concerns are not directly relevant to the neighbor's security. This is exemplified by situations involving Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, and Maldives, where India's concern over perceived Chinese influence was not necessarily reciprocated by its neighbors. 

The article criticizes this approach, highlighting the importance of respecting the sovereignty and strategic autonomy of neighboring nations. It suggests that India's focus on security overtures should be balanced with fostering greater mutual trust and confidence through platforms like the Colombo Security Conclave (CSC). The CSC, while currently focused on non-traditional security threats, could evolve into a more comprehensive forum for regional cooperation, lessening reliance on extra-regional powers and promoting collaborative security solutions.

Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) often co-exists with other mental health conditions. Studies show that between 50% and 90% of children and 85% of adults with ADHD have additional diagnoses, such as anxiety, depression, bipolar disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and obsessive-compulsive disorder. 

These co-occurring conditions can create a complex web of challenges, leading to issues like substance abuse and poor lifestyle choices. They may also overshadow each other, making diagnosis and treatment more difficult. 

Understanding the interconnectedness of these conditions is crucial. Early and accurate diagnosis, combined with comprehensive treatment plans, can help individuals manage their symptoms and improve their overall well-being.

India's relationship with Myanmar's military junta is a complex one, driven by strategic necessity and ethical dilemmas. Despite the junta's waning authority, its continued power is seen as essential for regional stability, countering China's influence, and combating the narcotics trade.  However, the junta's human rights abuses and the growing presence of Chinese-backed militias pose significant challenges.  India's policy involves a delicate balance: engaging with the junta to maintain stability while pushing for a long-term transition to democracy.   This requires careful navigation of regional dynamics and a commitment to sustained pressure on the junta to improve its conduct.

This article discusses President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw from the 2024 presidential race, attributing his exit to mounting pressure from Democrats concerned about his age and mental acuity, evidenced by poor debate performances and declining poll numbers. 

Despite claiming to step down for the "greater good" and to ensure a united Democratic front, Biden's actions are viewed as a calculated move to secure a legacy by endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor, solidifying his influence over the party. This move, despite opposition from some Democrats who favored a more open nominating process, was facilitated by polling data showing Biden trailing Trump and Harris performing slightly better. 

The article argues that Biden, aware he couldn't secure the nomination in an open contest, used his leverage to dictate the terms of his exit, forcing the party to embrace Harris as his heir apparent. It also highlights dissent within the Democratic ranks, particularly aimed at Harris serving as the nominee without prior contestation.

Tarun Tahiliani's designs for the Indian Olympic contingent in Paris drew heavy criticism for their lackluster style.  Many felt the designs did not represent the richness of Indian textiles or the global platform the Olympics provided for fashion. 

Despite this, Tahiliani defended his choices, stating they were not meant to be couture and that the focus should be on medals. He explained the uniforms reflected everyday Indian attire and cited interest from industrialists who wanted similar outfits.

This article argues that Pakistan's support for terrorism against India demands a comprehensive and robust response.  The author contends that Pakistan's jihad against India is deeply rooted in Islamist ideology and has gained traction in various regions, including Kashmir, Kerala, and West Bengal.

The article proposes several solutions, including strengthening border security, revitalizing human intelligence networks, engaging in community outreach, and cracking down on Islamist organizations. It emphasizes the need for a "carrot and stick" approach, incentivizing patriotism and deterring extremism through strict measures. 

The author advocates for a shift from diplomatic and internal security initiatives to military action, including surgical strikes, covert operations, and the potential for a limited-scale war.  He believes that inflicting substantial costs on Pakistan will compel it to reassess its support for terrorism.

The author argues that India's economic growth, while impressive,  is not inclusive and fails to benefit the majority of its population.  

They stress the need to prioritize foundational reforms focusing on sectors like agriculture, which employs a significant portion of the workforce but suffers from low productivity and stagnant incomes. 

The author criticizes budget allocations that focus on subsidies and palliatives rather than investing in research and development, infrastructure, food processing, and a guaranteed minimum support price for farmers. They believe empowering rural India through higher agricultural incomes will have a positive multiplier effect on the overall economy, boosting demand and driving inclusivity.

The potential return of Donald Trump to the US presidency could significantly impact India-US relations. Trump's "America First" economic policies, characterized by tariffs and protectionism, may negatively affect Indian exports but could also lead to increased investment in India as businesses seek alternatives to China. 

Migration policies, however, pose a concern, potentially becoming stricter and impacting Indian IT professionals and students. Conversely, defense and military cooperation is likely to strengthen, with continued support for India's military modernization and a shared focus on countering Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific. 


Overall, a Trump 2.0 presidency could present both challenges and opportunities for India, depending on the diplomatic strategies employed.

Tarun Tahiliani's designs for the Indian contingent at the 2024 Paris Olympics have been met with criticism.  Many, including badminton player Jwala Gutta, feel the sarees, featuring an ikat print, were impractical and unflattering.  They pointed out the lack of thought given to the athletes' comfort and  the missed opportunity to showcase the true beauty of ikat weaving through more intricate embroidery or hand-painted details. The designs were deemed uninspiring and comparable to cheap, mass-produced pieces, a disappointing representation for such a prestigious event.

This article explores the potential for US interference in Indian domestic affairs under the guise of combating disinformation.  

It details a series of events organized by the US embassy in India, partnering with entities like IREX (funded by the Ford Foundation, Soros-backed Open Society, and staffed by ex-US officials), to promote "counter-disinformation" efforts. 

The author argues that these initiatives, despite claiming to promote democratic values, may be an attempt to influence political discourse and suppress dissenting voices in India, particularly those critical of the ruling BJP government. 

Drawing parallels with the Biden administration's reported pressure on Big Tech to censor certain viewpoints, the author questions the transparency and true motives behind these "counter-disinformation" campaigns. 


The article concludes by expressing concern about the erosion of trust between India and the US, warning that such covert operations could undermine their strategic partnership.

China recently brokered a peace agreement between Palestinian factions, including Hamas and Fatah, in Beijing. This agreement, hailed by China as a major diplomatic achievement, aims to form a united national government. 

However, the author questions the sincerity of China's peace-making efforts, citing the continued tensions between Saudi Arabia and Iran, despite their rapprochement facilitated by Beijing. The author also points out the limitations of the Palestinian agreement, arguing that Hamas's recent attacks on Israel undermine its legitimacy and that past unity agreements have failed. The author concludes by criticizing China's hypocrisy, noting their continued support for terrorism in other regions, particularly against India.

A new study by the Wildlife Institute of India reveals a unique bond between house sparrows and villagers in the Uttarakhand Himalayas.  Researchers found that sparrow populations migrate alongside villagers, leaving high-altitude villages with the onset of winter and returning when people return in the summer. This demonstrates a strong attachment between the sparrows and human presence.  

The study also discovered that high-altitude sparrows are larger than their lower-elevation counterparts, likely an adaptation to the colder climate. The research team is continuing to study sparrow populations in different high-altitude villages, including their diet and nesting habits, to better understand their adaptations and conservation needs.

The Olympic Games, dating back to 776 BC, remain a significant global event despite societal changes.  Their popularity stems from their ability to promote sportsmanship, international peace, and economic growth for host nations.  

Beyond their official purpose of fostering peace through sport, the Games have witnessed historical moments of reconciliation and unity, such as South Africa's participation in the 1992 Barcelona Games and the joint entry of North and South Korea in 2000 Sydney.  

Despite facing challenges in a world marked by violence and xenophobia, the Olympics provide a platform for athletes from diverse backgrounds to compete and inspire global audiences. They also highlight lesser-known sports and support para-athletes, generating significant economic benefits and fostering a shared sense of emotion and unity.

The US passage of the Resolve Tibet Bill reaffirms support for direct talks between China and the Dalai Lama's representatives, while acknowledging that China's claims on Tibet are historically inaccurate.  

The bill, which has drawn both praise and protest, faces challenges due to the ongoing US-China tensions and the requirement that the US recognizes Tibet as part of China.  

India's position regarding Tibet holds significance as it shares a lengthy border with Tibet and  has an ongoing dispute with China over this region. 
 
The bill also brings attention to the Dalai Lama's succession and the concerns surrounding China's influence on choosing his successor.  Ongoing tensions within Tibet, exemplified by the recent closure of a prominent Tibetan vocational high school, further complicate the situation.

The article analyzes the contrasting approaches of China and the US to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. While both claim support for the Two-State Solution, China is engaging with various Palestinian factions, seeking unity and reconciliation, while the US primarily aligns with Israel. 

China's efforts, including hosting a Palestinian unity conference, are seen as a push for peace and a challenge to the US-Israel dynamic. Israel criticizes China's engagement with groups like Hamas, while the US continues to provide strong support to Israel, as demonstrated by Prime Minister Netanyahu's recent address to the US Congress. 

Despite the complexities and deep divisions, the article emphasizes the importance of continued efforts towards peaceful coexistence and finding a solution to the longstanding conflict.

India's FY 2024-25 defence budget is marginally lower than the interim budget, at Rs 6.21 lakh crore. While this represents a high allocation for the ministry, it's still less than 2% of India's GDP. 

Despite a focus on domestic manufacturing and defence exports, concerns remain about the adequacy of the budget given  India's growing security challenges, particularly from China. 


The budget prioritises pay, allowances, pensions, and capital expenditures, leaving limited funds for modernization and R&D.  Critics note the need to separate these obligatory expenditures from the core defence budget. 
 India's defence exports reached Rs 21,083 crore in FY 2023-24, demonstrating a commitment to self-reliance. However, a greater allocation is deemed necessary  to address India's evolving security landscape and fully realize its defence potential.

In a recent address, Prime Minister Narendra Modi warned Pakistan against its continued use of terrorism against India, reminding them of the failure of their past attempts.  Pakistan, currently facing economic woes, persists with its reliance on terrorism despite internal security threats from groups like the TTP. This despite the country's security forces battling terrorist attacks and a significant number of casualties. 

The Pakistani military, acknowledging the security challenges, launched a new operation "Azm-e-Istehkam"  to combat terrorism.  The operation encompasses various aspects, including kinetic action, alongside political, diplomatic, socio-economic, and informational strategies. The army emphasized the collaborative nature of the operation, involving various government agencies.  Despite these efforts, concerns remain about the effectiveness of these measures, particularly regarding the control of smuggling and the spread of negative narratives against the Pakistani army and state.

The article analyzes potential shifts in US foreign policy if Donald Trump is re-elected in November. 

It suggests a return to Trump's previous policies, highlighting a possible shift from focusing on Europe and NATO to prioritizing the South China Sea and countering China.  He may end aid to Ukraine, pushing for negotiations to end the Russia-Ukraine war. In West Asia, Trump might adopt a tougher stance, unequivocally supporting Israel in the conflict with Hamas and maintaining pressure on Iran. The article concludes that a second Trump presidency could significantly alter the geopolitical landscape, particularly in its approach to Europe, the Middle East, and China.

China's crackdown on Uyghur Muslims in Xinjiang is now being extended to other Muslim minorities within China, such as the Hui in Yuxi.  

The Chinese government employs various tactics like mass surveillance, limitations on religious practices, and restrictions on cultural expression, all under the guise of "Sinification." The campaign aims to assimilate minorities into Han Chinese culture, disregarding their historical and religious identities. This suppression, exemplified by the monitoring of fasting schoolchildren and the banning of headscarves for civil servants, mirrors the harsh policies in Xinjiang.

Despite concerns over human rights violations and cultural eradication, China uses its economic influence to silence criticism from many Muslim-majority nations. While the West often focuses on Muslim issues within India, the situation in China remains largely unaddressed. A more inclusive and conciliatory approach towards minorities, including genuine dialogue and respect for cultural and religious freedoms, is crucial to achieving lasting peace and stability.

Student-led protests erupted in Bangladesh over the reinstatement of a 30% quota in government jobs for descendants of 1971 Liberation War freedom fighters.  The protests, initially sparked by a High Court ruling, turned violent, resulting in significant casualties and widespread internet and mobile network shutdowns.  The government imposed a curfew and detained protesters, including opposition leaders.  Despite a Supreme Court hold on the quota, protests continue, demanding its permanent abolishment and accountability from Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. The Indian government issued advisories, facilitated the return of Indian nationals, and heightened security along the border due to the unrest. The protests have strained relationships with India regarding treaties and the sharing of  Tista River water. China's growing influence in Bangladesh adds another layer of complexity to the situation, as Bangladesh seeks economic partnerships and assistance in infrastructure development.

### [25 years of Kargil: Lessons on high altitude aerial combat against a bigger enemy this time](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/25-years-of-kargil-lessons-on-high-altitude-aerial-combat-against-a-bigger-enemy-this-time-13797181.html)

The 1999 Kargil conflict with Pakistan serves as a valuable lesson for India's potential future conflict with China. Despite the Kargil victory, the war highlighted the need for improved intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance capabilities, particularly in the high-altitude regions. 

The Indian Air Force (IAF) gained valuable experience in precision bombing at extreme altitudes and adapted its tactics to counter Chinese threats. Significant progress has been made since Kargil, with modernization of the IAF, including the induction of Rafale fighters, BrahMos missiles, and advanced helicopters.

However, challenges remain. The Indian military still needs to increase its fighter squadron strength and invest further in electronic warfare and drone technology.  India must also focus on strengthening its air defense systems and enhancing the resilience of its airfields in potential high-altitude conflict zones. Lastly, the article emphasizes the importance of quick and decisive political action to equip the IAF with the necessary resources to effectively counter future threats.

### [Ramification | Bangladesh’s quota protests: A test for Sheikh Hasina’s leadership](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/ramification-bangladeshs-quota-protests-a-test-for-sheikh-hasinas-leadership-13797034.html)

Protests in Bangladesh, triggered by the reinstatement of a quota system favoring descendants of 1971 war heroes, escalated into violence, leaving over 150 dead. The situation intensified when Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina referred to protestors as "Razakars," a highly derogatory term for those who collaborated with Pakistan during the war, leading to further unrest.  

While the quota issue is central to the protests, some argue it's also a platform for opposition parties to challenge Hasina's governance.  Political parties and student wings have capitalized on the sentiment, with some alleging Indian interference in the elections.  

The Indian government has issued advisories and facilitated the return of Indian students amidst the unrest.  Regional stability is at stake, with experts highlighting the potential for anti-India forces to gain ground if the current government is toppled, jeopardizing India's Act East Policy and potentially turning Bangladesh into a hub for jihadi terrorism.

### [Great power politics: BRI and IMEEC at the crossroads of global influence](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/great-power-politics-bri-and-imeec-at-the-crossroads-of-global-influence-13797030.html)

The article analyzes the competition between China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the US-led India, Middle East, Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC).  It argues that China's economic rise has fueled its political ambitions to reshape the global order, challenging US hegemony. The US, through IMEEC, aims to counter China's influence, particularly in its near region.

While both initiatives share goals of connectivity and economic growth, IMEEC may be more successful if the US and its partners secure sufficient financial resources, given their democratic values, transparent financial systems, and global trust. The article suggests that BRI has faced criticism regarding debt-trap diplomacy and a lack of transparency. It concludes by noting India's preference for a more inclusive global order, contrasting both US and Chinese strategies with the potential for conflict.

India's approach to climate change emphasizes a balance between economic growth and environmental sustainability. 

Challenging the sole focus on global temperature targets, India highlights the interconnectedness of climate, human well-being, and ecological stability. Despite being a fast-growing economy, India's per capita carbon emissions remain low, and the country aims to achieve net-zero emissions by 2070. 

Key strategies include promoting renewable energy, enhancing energy efficiency, and prioritizing adaptation measures to address climate vulnerabilities. India's ancient ethos of harmony with nature informs its sustainable lifestyle model, offering a unique perspective on global climate action.

### [Reality check: Can India do anything about American interference in politics?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/reality-check-can-india-do-anything-about-american-interference-in-politics-13796897.html)

The article discusses the US's influence operations in India through cultural exchanges and the challenges it poses to Indian sovereignty.  It highlights how the US, with its greater resources and global influence, can attract and shape Indian intellectuals and influencers, often with agendas that may not align with Indian interests. 

The author argues that India is caught in a trap, as responding with censorship only worsens its image internationally. It acknowledges that such influence operations are not new, citing historical examples of Soviet and US interventions.  The article suggests that India's global Indian community could become a powerful counter-force by promoting Indian interests abroad, learning from successful models like Israel's cultural tourism initiative.  Finally, it emphasizes the hidden nature of cultural warfare, making it difficult to track and counter US influence.

### [Is Iraq the missing piece in India’s corridor strategy?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/is-iraq-the-missing-piece-in-indias-corridor-strategy-13796760.html)

The article discusses India's diplomatic and economic interests in the Middle East, focusing on alternatives to the India-Middle East Economic Corridor (IMEEC). 

While the IMEEC focuses on a route through Iran, the author argues that Iraq presents a more viable and stable option for India.  They highlight India's long-standing historical and cultural ties with Iraq, despite fluctuating political climates,  and point to the recent economic growth and stability in Iraq. 

The author suggests India should strengthen its investment and trade ties with Iraq, citing opportunities for Indian businesses and the potential for a new trade route that can benefit both countries.

### [China’s inward turn: A path to stability or stagnation?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/chinas-inward-turn-a-path-to-stability-or-stagnation-13796645.html)

China's recent economic and political moves signal a concerning inward focus.  Despite a large trade surplus, economic growth is slowing, domestic consumption is weak, and high savings rates reveal anxieties about social stability.  

Internal issues are also plaguing the military, with recent purges highlighting corruption and inefficiencies within its ranks. This casts doubt on China's military capabilities despite significant weaponry advancements.  

The property market is teetering on the brink of collapse, with major developers facing financial distress. The government's reluctance to intervene exacerbates this issue.

China's ambitions, such as the Belt and Road Initiative, are facing setbacks, and its assertive foreign policy has led to increased international tension. The author argues that China's rigid control measures, prioritizing stability over economic freedom, may ultimately hinder its long-term growth.

The article also reflects on the sacrifices made by Indian soldiers in general, referencing other notable figures like Lieutenant Manoj Pandey and Captain Vikram Batra. It emphasizes the importance of the Indian Army's ethos, including courage, dedication, and putting the country first. While acknowledging the pride in their sacrifice, the article stresses the need to address the root causes of terrorism and prevent such incidents from recurring.  The author concludes by calling for a strong response to the threat posed by terrorism and the need to plug security loopholes.

### [Kamala Harris’ advent infuses energy and hope in Democrats, but is it too late?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/kamala-harris-advent-infuses-energy-and-hope-in-democrats-but-is-it-too-late-13796463.html)

Joe Biden's withdrawal from the presidential race after months of declining health and pressure from his party paved the way for Kamala Harris to become the Democratic nominee.  Despite widespread support, including endorsements from prominent figures like Bill and Hillary Clinton, Harris'  nomination lacks the transparency and competitiveness ideal for selecting a strong candidate to challenge Donald Trump.  Questions remain about her electability, particularly among white voters, and the missed opportunity for a more rigorous selection process could impact the Democratic party's chances in the upcoming election.

### [Budget 2024 lays blueprint for Viksit Bharat: Centre is facilitator, private sector, MSMEs drivers of growth](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/budget-2024-lays-blueprint-for-viksit-bharat-centre-is-facilitator-private-sector-msmes-drivers-of-growth-13796060.html)

The article analyzes the  implications of the central government's shift in approach, as outlined in the recent budget speech.  

The government, under this new strategy, prioritizes facilitating economic activities rather than directly funding them. It plans to achieve this through incentives, guarantees, and nudges rather than grants or direct investments. The article cites examples like loan guarantees for states and MSMEs,  financial  incentives for employers to hire regular employees, and a new internship program that leverages corporate social responsibility funds. 
Ultimately, the article argues that this shift reflects a conscious decision to move away from direct financial involvement and embrace a more facilitative role.

### [Eco Survey 2024: Amid high growth India’s future appears bright, but a ‘grand alliance’ to tame unemployment is required](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/eco-survey-2024-amid-high-growth-indias-future-appears-bright-but-a-grand-alliance-to-tame-unemployment-is-required-13795928.html)

The Economic Survey for 2023-24 highlights both positive and concerning aspects of India's economic landscape.  The survey points to robust economic growth, controlled inflation, and favorable trade figures. However, it expresses caution about the challenges ahead, including slower private sector investment, declining inflow of foreign direct investment, and the pressing issue of unemployment.  

The survey acknowledges the lack of reliable data on job creation, making it difficult to accurately assess the situation. It emphasizes the need for a "grand alliance" among the central, state governments, and the private sector to overcome these hurdles and foster sustained high growth.  Private sector growth and investment are seen as crucial for job creation, while tripartite compacts are suggested to bridge the gap between skills development and market demands.  The survey recognizes the need to adapt to the evolving global landscape, marked by protectionism, geopolitical uncertainty, climate change, and the disruptive potential of Artificial Intelligence.

### [US Sutra | Biden withdraws from presidential race, but road remains bumpy for Democrats](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/biden-withdraws-from-presidential-race-but-road-remains-bumpy-for-democrats-13795718.html)

In a surprising turn of events, Joe Biden officially announced his withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race, endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris as his successor. 

Despite Biden's numerous accomplishments throughout his career, his decision to step down comes less than four months before the election, creating a chaotic scenario for the Democrats.  The move, perhaps influenced by recent events such as Trump's assassination attempt and choice of running mate, is unlikely to offer any substantial electoral advantage to Harris. Democrats face an uphill battle to unify behind a candidate in such a short time frame, grappling with Harris' record and approval ratings which are comparable to Biden's.  The party must now rally and find a way to effectively challenge Trump's candidacy in the upcoming months.

### [Budget 2024 expectations: Empowering women farmers with technology to transform India's agricultural economy](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/budget-2024-empowering-women-farmers-with-technology-to-transform-indias-agricultural-economy-13795665.html)

The article highlights the crucial role of women in agriculture and the need to address the technological disparities they face.  Despite their significant contributions, women farmers often lack access to modern technology, credit, and education, hindering their productivity and economic empowerment.  

The article calls for targeted policy interventions, including:

* **Financial support**:  Accessible credit facilities and financial aid without collateral.
* **Education and training**:  Programs focusing on agricultural practices, financial management, and entrepreneurship tailored to women's needs.

### [The horror of Razakars haunts Bangladesh again](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/the-horror-of-razakars-haunts-bangladesh-again-13795631.html)

Protests in Bangladesh over the quota system for government jobs have escalated into violence, leading to deaths and injuries. The protests stem from a High Court order restoring 30% of government jobs for family members of freedom fighters, a decision subsequently reduced to 5% by the Supreme Court. 

While the Supreme Court aimed to appease the students, the protests continue, fueled by allegations of the government insulting freedom fighters and  evoking memories of the 1971 war and the collaborators known as Razakars, resulting in a highly charged social climate. The situation has been further complicated by social media narratives and calls to rally against the government, heightening tensions and raising concerns about the stability of  democracy in Bangladesh.

A July 2024 global disruption affecting airlines, banks, and other sectors was caused by a logical error in a content update by Crowdstrike's Falcon Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR) tool. This error, leading to a Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) on impacted Windows systems, underscores the critical importance of stringent quality checks in software development. 

EDR solutions, increasingly used to safeguard against sophisticated cyber threats, monitor endpoint activities for malicious behavior based on Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs).  Crowdstrike's  update, aimed at addressing these evolving threats, inadvertently introduced a flaw that caused the OS crash. The error highlights the potential risks associated with high-priority deployments potentially sacrificing thorough testing, emphasizing the trade-off between speed and quality in cybersecurity.

The ongoing conflicts in Eurasia and the Middle East highlight the failure of the international rules-based order, as defiance and unilateralism prevail. The ICJ ruling on Israeli settlements in the West Bank, while morally and legally significant, is unlikely to change the ground situation. Despite this, several Arab countries, including the UAE and Saudi Arabia, have condemned Israeli actions and called for a resumption of the peace process.  

Tensions remain high, with both Israel and Hamas facing limitations in achieving their goals. While the US seeks a ceasefire and plans for postwar management, the situation is fraught with challenges.  

Thousands have been killed and displaced, with potential for further escalation and wider conflict.  The overall outcome of these conflicts appears to be a loss for all parties involved, raising serious concerns for regional and international security.

### [Sanity prevailed: Karnataka has done right thing by hitting pause button on local job quota bill](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/karnataka-has-paused-local-job-quota-bill-a-right-step-13795355.html)

The article critiques the Haryana State Employment of Local Candidates Act, 2020, and the proposed Karnataka State Employment of Local Industries Factories Establishment Act, 2024, both of which mandate a certain percentage of employment for local residents. 

The author argues that these acts are unconstitutional, detrimental to economic growth, and stifle innovation.  The Punjab and Haryana High Court already ruled the Haryana Act unconstitutional, emphasizing the violation of fundamental principles like equality before the law and the right to equal employment opportunities.  

The author further points out that such policies deter foreign investment, reduce labor mobility, and hinder the free flow of skilled workers, all of which are crucial for a dynamic and innovative economy. Using the success of Silicon Valley as an example, the article emphasizes the crucial role of immigration and internal migration in fostering innovation and economic growth.

### [Two contrasting museums that showcase Mumbai’s spirit](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/two-contrasting-museums-that-showcase-mumbais-spirit-13795346.html)

This article contrasts two Mumbai museums: the National Museum of Indian Cinema and the BEST Transport Museum. 

The National Museum of Indian Cinema, housed in a grand, historic building,  traces the evolution of Indian filmmaking from its early days to modern classics, showcasing technology, iconic figures, and the influence of cinema on society.

In stark contrast, the BEST Transport Museum, tucked away inside a bus depot, focuses on the history of Mumbai's public transportation, particularly the buses that are vital to the city's life. It features models of buses, historical artifacts, and the story of the BEST organization's evolution alongside Mumbai's growth.  The article laments the lesser-known status of the transport museum compared to its cinematic counterpart, highlighting a unique aspect of Mumbai's identity.

The upcoming Union Budget is expected to focus on skills, employment, and innovation.  A key concern is the shortage of skilled workers in crucial sectors like health, manufacturing, and technology.  

The government has emphasized providing employable skills to vulnerable populations, particularly school dropouts, aiming to address the unemployment crisis and bolster economic growth. However, the effectiveness of existing programs like Skill India has been questioned due to issues like delayed implementation and lack of job placement support. Experts argue for a greater emphasis on aligning skill development with industry needs and  strengthening collaboration with the private sector. 


A significant investment in up-skilling initiatives for gig workers is also crucial, given their growing number and contribution to the economy.

The article discusses the assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump and its implications for American democracy. It draws parallels with historical events like the assassination of President John F. Kennedy and  questions the role of "gun culture" and the Second Amendment in such incidents.

The attempt has reignited debates about the "Deep State" and its influence on American politics, with Trump supporters alleging its involvement. The article also touches upon concerns about President Joe Biden's physical and mental health amidst this political climate.  

It concludes by highlighting the lack of information about the attempted assassin and the broader concerns about accountability and transparency within the US government.

### [Skyfall: The assassin’s bullet that Donald Trump dodged with minimal damage has hit Joe Biden instead](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/skyfall-the-assassins-bullet-that-donald-trump-dodged-with-minimal-damage-has-hit-joe-biden-instead-13795247.html)

A tumultuous week in US politics saw Donald Trump, coming off an assassination attempt, garnering support and momentum at the Republican National Convention in Milwaukee. Meanwhile, Joe Biden faces increasing pressure from his own party to withdraw from the race, amidst concerns about his age and mental acuity. This pressure comes from high-profile Democrats like Nancy Pelosi, and even former President Barack Obama. Despite a series of unflattering polls and dwindling support from mega-donors, Biden remains defiant and refuses to step aside.  Trump, on the other hand, continues to fundraise strongly, with many donors responding to both the near-death experience and his new display of unity within the Republican Party.


This contrasting trajectory suggests a potential shift in the political landscape, with Biden struggling while Trump utilizes the shocking events to further unify his base.

The article discusses India's balancing act between its relationship with Russia and the West, particularly in light of the ongoing Ukraine war.  

Despite Western criticism of India's decision to purchase Russian oil and maintain neutrality in the conflict, the article argues that India has legitimate strategic reasons for its actions. India sees Russia as a crucial partner in maintaining regional stability, while also recognizing the economic and political importance of its ties with the West.  The author acknowledges the challenges of balancing these relationships, highlighting the inherent limitations of both sides and emphasizing the need for strategic foresight rather than knee-jerk reactions. Ultimately, the article advocates for a pragmatic approach that prioritizes India's national interests while navigating the complex geopolitical landscape.

The article argues that the recent surge in terrorism in Jammu and Kashmir is not a temporary anomaly, but a symptom of a deeper, long-lasting problem.  The author contends that India's approach to Pakistan has been flawed, driven by a  misunderstanding of the religious fervor behind Pakistan's animosity towards India. 

He points to Pakistan's strategy of using proxy war,  cultivating support for radical ideology within India, and exploiting existing divisions, as evidence of its long-term objective to destabilize India. 

The author criticizes India's obsession with elections as a solution, arguing that it overlooks the fundamental ideological conflict at play. 

He concludes by urging India to adopt a more comprehensive and strategic approach to counter Pakistan's terrorism, acknowledging the threat of radicalization within India and the need to address the underlying causes of the conflict.

### [Budget 2024: Optimising resources for better educational outcomes](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/budget-2024-optimising-resources-for-better-educational-outcomes-13795085.html)

Investing in India's education sector requires a focus on high-return initiatives that address the learning crisis. While expenditure on education has increased, learning outcomes remain poor. The NIPUN Bharat Mission, launched to improve foundational literacy and numeracy (FLN) by Grade 3, has faced challenges due to delayed implementation and low state capacity. 

To maximize the impact, the government should transition to three-year rolling disbursements for states, allowing for better planning and resource utilization.  States should prioritize early childhood education, teacher training, school-based assessments, and awareness campaigns to create a sustainable impact on FLN skills. By strengthening these areas, India can ensure every child has the opportunity to succeed.

### [Nepal has a new prime minister and it may be good news for China](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/nepal-has-a-new-prime-minister-and-it-may-be-good-news-for-china-13795067.html)

KP Sharma Oli, Nepal's new Prime Minister, is known for his pro-China stance and anti-India and anti-West views. As he enters his fourth term, he is expected to further consolidate Nepal's ties with China.  

Oli's past actions, such as signing a Transit Treaty with China and agreeing to an Extradition Treaty, demonstrate his commitment to reducing Nepal's reliance on India and aligning with China's strategic interests. This is particularly significant in the context of Tibet, where Nepal hosts a significant population of Tibetan refugees who are seen as a concern by China due to their anti-Chinese sentiment.  

China's growing influence is also evident in Nepal's participation in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and the Sagarmatha Friendship Joint Military Exercise.  Oli's government is likely to face challenges in balancing its relationships with China, India, and the United States, especially given the recent US legislation supporting Tibetan rights.  The outcome of this balancing act will have significant implications for Nepal's foreign policy and its regional role.

### [Beyond third plenum: China’s slowing economy demands a more consensus-based approach from Beijing](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/beyond-third-plenum-chinas-slowing-economy-demands-a-more-consensus-based-approach-from-beijing-13795041.html)

China's economic growth, once a roaring double-digit engine, has drastically slowed to single digits. This year, it is projected to grow by just 4.5%, with the International Monetary Fund predicting further decline to 3% by 2029.  

The real estate sector, once a key driver of the economy, is in crisis, and government stimulus efforts have been ineffective. Consumer demand remains weak, and exports are facing headwinds due to global economic uncertainty and rising tensions with trading partners. 

As China grapples with an aging population and rising debt, the government is pursuing a strategy of "high quality development" focused on advanced manufacturing and technology. However, this transition faces challenges, including a lack of global enthusiasm for Chinese high-tech products and trade restrictions imposed by key markets.

### [How China’s growing clout in South Caucasus can be challenging for India](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-chinas-growing-clout-in-south-caucasus-can-be-challenging-for-india-13794912.html)

China's growing influence in the South Caucasus, demonstrated by the launch of direct flights from Urumqi to Yerevan, raises concerns for India.  China's ambitions in the region, fuelled by its economic prowess and strategic partnerships with key players, directly challenge India's interests in the International North-South Trade Corridor (INSTC).  

India aims to maximize the benefits of the INSTC and counter the burgeoning alliance between Turkey, Pakistan, and Azerbaijan, which China is increasingly aligning with. This Chinese expansion, coupled with Azerbaijan's reluctance to support India's proposed INSTC route through Armenia, poses a significant threat to India's regional aspirations. 


Russia, with its established relationships in the South Caucasus, could potentially act as a counterbalancing force to China's growing presence and support India's connectivity goals.

Sheikh Hasina's recent trip to China yielded meagre results, prompting her to seek a $1 billion financing plan from India for the Teesta River redevelopment project.  Successful implementation could resolve water-sharing disputes, enhance economic ties, and counter China's influence in South Asia. 

However, India must balance regional goodwill with domestic concerns, as West Bengal may oppose generous allocations. Bangladesh's economic vulnerabilities, such as reliance on garment exports and mounting socioeconomic challenges, necessitate a cautious approach.  

Investing in Bangladesh requires a strategic and diversified strategy that acknowledges both the opportunities and risks. The Teesta project, while promising, must be part of a broader framework for engagement.

The recent summit between India and Russia in Moscow saw the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding focusing on trade, economic, and investment cooperation in the Russian Far East and Arctic. This development strengthens India's ties with Russia amidst increasing concern about China's growing influence in the Arctic. 

China, which sees the Arctic as crucial for its "Polar Silk Road" and access to resources, has been expanding its military, economic, and diplomatic presence in the region. However, its ambitions have raised concerns from the US and other Arctic nations, who see a potential threat to their security interests.  

India, with its existing cordial relations with all Arctic Council members, has the potential to play a key role in ensuring stability and sustainable development in the region.  

The article suggests that India should take a more active role in the Arctic, leveraging its relationship with Russia and considering the potential for securing access to critical minerals. This could shape regional dynamics and counterbalance China's growing assertiveness.

Masoud Pezeshkian, a reformist, won Iran's recent presidential election, signaling a shift in leadership. Pezeshkian supports a balanced foreign policy and aims to strengthen relations with neighbors.  His likely foreign minister, Javed Zarif, played a key role in the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, raising hopes for its revival. 

However, the deal has been stalled since 2022 due to disagreements over US sanctions, the IRGC's designation as a foreign terrorist organization, and Iran's nuclear advancements. The recent war in Gaza further complicates the situation. 


While Iran currently lacks the need for a nuclear weapon and its defense doctrine excludes it, the possibility of a regional arms race looms.  The US presidential election cycle adds another layer of complexity, making a swift revival of the nuclear deal unlikely.

An assassination attempt on former US President Donald Trump has reignited concerns about toxic politics in both the US and India. While Biden has called for de-escalation, the attack has seemingly benefited Trump, boosting his popularity.  In India, Prime Minister Modi faces relentless verbal attacks from the Opposition, with  incidents of hateful rhetoric becoming increasingly common. The threats against Modi, emboldene by  extremist groups, highlight the dangers of such escalation.  

Elections in Maharashtra and Haryana are approaching, and the article urges the Indian Opposition to focus on policy solutions rather than personal attacks on Modi.  It argues that such negativity can ultimately harm the Opposition more than the ruling party.

Violent protests erupted at Dhaka University and other universities in Bangladesh following the reinstatement of a quota system for government jobs. The system, which reserves a portion of seats for children of freedom fighters, was scrapped in 2018 but reinstated by the High Court in July 2024. This sparked protests, leading to clashes and deaths.  The situation highlights the historical role of Dhaka University as a center of political and social activism. The institution has witnessed numerous protests and upheavals throughout its history, including the Language Movement and the Bangladeshi Liberation War. The current violence raises concerns about the potential for exploitation of student grievances for political ends.  The government seeks to quell the unrest and restore peace, but the future of the quota system remains uncertain.

The article criticizes Germany's left-leaning government for its intolerant policies despite claiming to safeguard democracy. 

It highlights the government's hypocrisy in criticizing India's alleged human rights violations while suppressing dissenting voices within Germany itself. The author points to the closure of the right-wing magazine Compact as an example of this  suppression, arguing that it violates freedom of speech and is driven by political expediency. The article further suggests that the government's handling of immigration and its economic policies have contributed to the rise of right-wing sentiments, which are now being met with authoritarian measures.

Recent terrorist attacks in Jammu signal a shift in strategy by militant groups. Following the abrogation of Article 370, terrorists are moving focus from the heavily guarded Kashmir Valley to the more vulnerable Jammu region. Pakistani groups are exploiting Jammu's terrain and local networks to infiltrate and launch attacks. Security agencies fear further escalation, with warnings of potential suicide attacks. 

In response, the Indian government has increased security measures in Jammu, including launching search operations and deploying additional forces. Home Minister Amit Shah has called for a zero-tolerance approach to terrorism and ordered the army to take  aggressive action. The government is also cracking down on terrorist financing and taking steps to ensure the safety of pilgrims during the upcoming Amarnath Yatra.

The article discusses the impact of an assassination attempt on Donald Trump's 2024 presidential campaign. Trump narrowly escaped injury when an assailant opened fire at a rally in Pennsylvania. While the Republican perceives this as an attempt to regain control and rally his supporters, the Democrats portray it as a consequence of heightened political rhetoric. 

The article highlights growing concerns about President Biden's age and fitness for office, with some Democrats advocating for a younger candidate. The attempted assassination on Trump is considered a turning point in his campaign, potentially boosting his support.

The article examines the US-China technological competition, highlighting China's rapid progress in various fields.  

China leads in patent applications and grants, boasting a strong presence in research output, particularly in areas crucial for national security and technological advancement such as hypersonic missiles, artificial intelligence, and quantum computing. 

Although facing a US-led restriction on access to certain technologies, China has strategically cultivated its own technological prowess through government-backed research programs, incentivizing STEM fields, and investing heavily in renewable energy and manufacturing. 

While acknowledging US innovation strengths in established companies like NVIDIA, Amazon, and Apple, the article suggests that China's fast-growing domestic tech giants coupled with its ambitious long-term planning pose a significant challenge to US technological dominance.

### [Why no second chances for Vance?](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/why-no-second-chances-for-vance-13794036.html)

JD Vance, the youngest VP nominee since Richard Nixon, has faced swift and harsh criticism from liberal commentators. His compelling life story, rising from poverty in the Rust Belt, resonates with many Americans but challenges the prevailing narrative of diversity and inclusion. Vance's background, including his educational achievements and military service, contrasts with the media's portrayal of poor white men.  

His selection as running mate by Donald Trump signifies a generational shift within the Republican Party, appealing to younger voters. This move, coupled with Vance's staunch stance on Ukraine and controversial statements, suggests a potential drive to reshape the government and solidify the MAGA agenda.  Despite criticism stemming from past negative comments about Trump, Vance's evolution and connection to Republican and Democratic voters through his wife Usha offer a unique narrative that Trump may leverage for political gain.

The article draws a parallel between recent attempts on former US President Donald Trump's life and historical events like the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in 1914 and French General Francois Darlan in 1942. Both archduke and Darlan were seen as controversial figures whose deaths, orchestrated by young individuals,  precipitated significant historical shifts.  The author speculates on the possibility of these seemingly isolated incidents representing a recurring pattern of history, where young attackers disrupt the status quo, often with fatal consequences for themselves.

### [The epidemic of ultra-processed food in the developing world](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/the-epidemic-of-ultra-processed-food-in-the-developing-world-13793859.html)

A recent study highlighted the alarmingly high sugar content in baby food products in India, Africa, and Latin America compared to Europe. This raises concerns about children developing a taste for sugary foods from a young age, potentially leading to future health problems like obesity and type 2 diabetes.  

The study also points to the growing prevalence of ultra-processed foods (UPFs) in developing countries, driven by aggressive marketing from multinational corporations. These UPFs, often high in sugar, salt, and additives, have been linked to a range of health issues in both adults and children, contributing to the global obesity epidemic.  

The article calls for governments to strengthen regulations on food products and encourage healthier dietary choices, shifting away from the reliance on processed foods and towards more traditional diets.

This event serves as a wake-up call for the American political system, emphasizing the erosion of democratic norms and the increasing acceptance of extreme measures. 

The attack, occurring during a critical point in the electoral campaign with Trump gaining momentum, underscores the potential desperation of his opponents and the dangerous tactics employed in a highly divided political climate. The incident raises questions about the motives behind the attack, the role of left-wing extremism, and the media's impact on exacerbating tensions.  

Ultimately, this moment demands a commitment to democratic values, electoral integrity, and a renewed emphasis on civil discourse.

An assassination attempt on Donald Trump during a rally in Pennsylvania has dramatically shifted the US presidential race.  A shooter fired on Trump, causing a minor injury, but the former president continued with the rally, showcasing resilience.

### [Time to normalise mental health issues: Seeking help is strength](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/time-to-normalise-mental-health-issues-seeking-help-is-strength-13793604.html)

The author recounts their experience transforming from a fearless rescuer of road accident victims to a timid individual suffering from phobias and panic attacks. This shift, they believe, was triggered by the cumulative impact of witnessing numerous traumatic events. Despite medication and therapy, the author initially struggled to overcome their anxiety. Years later, upon seeking help from a psychiatrist again, they experienced significant improvement and regained their former self.  The author emphasizes the destigmatization of mental health, noting the increasing prevalence of stress, depression, and anxiety. They urge readers to seek help and inspire open conversations about mental health challenges.

### [Not only machines, but men behind them: Getting Indian Army future-ready](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/not-only-machines-but-men-behind-them-getting-indian-army-future-ready-13793530.html)

This article explores the balance between human resources and force modernization in the Indian Army's transformation drive. 

The author argues that while technology is increasingly crucial in warfare, it is not a guaranteed path to victory.  History shows that technological advancements often provide tactical advantages that can be countered, and  human factors like esprit de corps and cohesion remain vital.

The Indian Army is undergoing reforms to increase the youthfulness and education levels of its soldiers, but these changes must not negatively impact existing regimental camaraderie. 

Finding the right balance between human resource management and modernization is a key challenge for the Indian defense establishment.  It requires careful consideration of budgetary allocations and the understanding that technology alone cannot guarantee success in future conflicts.

### [How BIMSTEC in east and IMEC in west can make India central to Asian-European connectivity](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-bimstec-in-east-and-imec-in-west-can-make-india-central-to-asian-european-connectivity-13793487.html)

Prime Minister Modi's recent visits to Italy and Russia demonstrate India's strategic balancing act as it navigates its relationships with major powers.  

India's historical ties with Russia, rooted in shared anti-colonial sentiments and the desire to counter Chinese influence in Central Asia, remain strong. However, India also recognizes the value of its partnership with the West, particularly in the face of China's growing assertiveness.  
 
India seeks to leverage its influence in the Bay of Bengal region through BIMSTEC, an economic and technical cooperation organization. By developing infrastructure and trade partnerships in BIMSTEC countries, India aims to counter China's growing presence in the Indo-Pacific. 


This strategic approach, combining a pragmatic relationship with Russia and a developing footprint in the Indo-Pacific, allows India to pursue its national interests while managing the complexities of a multipolar world.

### [Securing supply chains: Why critical minerals are important aspect of Indo-American partnership](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/securing-supply-chains-why-critical-minerals-are-important-aspect-of-indo-american-partnership-13793358.html)

The India-US partnership is deepening, particularly in the realm of critical minerals.  Adding critical minerals to the India-US Initiative on Critical and Emerging Technology (iCET) aims to create a more resilient and secure supply chain for both nations, especially in defence, clean energy, and technology sectors.  

This partnership includes co-investments in lithium and rare earth projects, a Bilateral Critical Minerals Memorandum of Understanding, and advanced materials R&D collaboration. Achieving self-reliance in critical materials is crucial for both countries to ensure national security and technological innovation.  The initiative sets a precedent for international cooperation in securing critical resources in an increasingly interconnected world.

### [25 years of Kargil war: When Indian armed forces achieved near impossible](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/25-years-of-kargil-war-when-indian-armed-forces-achieved-near-impossible-13793301.html)

The Kargil conflict, which began in 1999, saw Pakistan infiltrate Indian territory along the Line of Control. Despite initial intelligence failures and a sense of disbelief within Pakistani leadership, the Indian Army successfully evicted the intruders after a grueling three-month campaign.  

The operation, dubbed Operation Vijay, involved fierce hand-to-hand combat at high altitudes, with Indian soldiers facing heavy enemy fire and challenging terrain.  The Indian Air Force (IAF) played a significant role in the conflict, conducting targeted airstrikes and reconnaissance missions despite initial challenges and losses.  

The Kargil conflict showcased the Indian armed forces' bravery and resilience.  It demonstrated India's decisiveness in defending its territory and sent a clear message to Pakistan that aggression would be met with strong resistance. The conflict also had broader geopolitical implications, weakening Pakistan's standing and strengthening India's relationship with the United States, which led to support for India's nuclear program.

### [Israel-Lebanon conflict and chances of a full-scale war](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/israel-lebanon-conflict-and-chances-of-a-full-scale-war-13793231.html)

The long-standing conflict between Israel and Lebanon has escalated recently, with heavy fighting and cross-border attacks.  While a significant portion of Israelis support international political solutions, a military approach is favored by some, particularly given the Netanyahu regime's current political climate.  

Israel justifies potential action by citing Hezbollah's attacks and the displacement of Israeli citizens.  However,  public opinion leans towards diplomacy, reflecting the desire to avoid a full-scale war with its unpredictable consequences.   Despite Hezbollah's military capability, Israel arguably possesses a significant advantage in resources and potential international support.

### [Trump assassination attempt: Why it's noteworthy for India](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/donald-trump-assassination-attempt-lessons-for-india-13793174.html)

A gunman attempted to assassinate Donald Trump at a rally in Pennsylvania, shooting a bullet that grazed his ear. Despite the attack, Trump remained defiant, urging his supporters to "fight, fight, fight!" 

The event sparked differing reactions in the media. While acknowledging the incident, some outlets initially downplayed its severity, leading to criticism for their handling of the news. 

The article argues that the escalation of rhetoric against Trump, depicting him as a dangerous figure, contributed to the climate that possibly emboldened the shooter. It compares this to the situation in India, highlighting the potential threats faced by high-profile individuals and urging Indian security agencies to learn from the incident.

### [China’s Panchsheel embrace: A smokescreen for aggression](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/chinas-panchsheel-embrace-a-smokescreen-for-aggression-13793123.html)

China's recent emphasis on the Panchsheel principles appears disingenuous, according to the article.  

Despite proclaiming these principles, China has allegedly violated them repeatedly, particularly in its relations with India. The article cites examples such as China's occupation of Indian territories, aggressive posturing and support for Pakistan's hostility towards India.  

It argues that China is using the Panchsheel as a smokescreen to deflect criticism from its own actions and attempts to manipulate the Global South. The author urges the Indian government to recognize this and work to prevent China from exploiting the principles for its own advantage.

### [Bhupinder Singh Rawat: Remembering the ‘Scooter’ who raced his way to success in Indian football](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/bhupinder-singh-rawat-remembering-the-scooter-who-raced-his-way-to-success-in-indian-football-13792991.html)

Bhupinder Rawat, nicknamed "Scooter" for his exceptional speed, was one of India's most prolific centre forwards. Despite his short stature, he was a force on the field, renowned for his agility and accurate strikes. 

Rawat gained recognition for his performance in the 1966 Durand Cup, scoring 12 goals and leading his team, the Gorkha Brigade, to victory.  He earned a place in the Indian national team for the 1969 Merdeka Cup, proving his doubters wrong with a string of impressive headers during the selection process.  Known for his sportsmanship and friendly nature, Rawat was a beloved figure in Indian football circles.

### [Yes, Nehru played a role in Austria’s emergence as independent nation, but that’s just half the story](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/yes-nehru-played-a-role-in-austrias-emergence-as-independent-nation-but-thats-just-half-the-story-13792963.html)

The article debunks the Austrian "first victim" theory, which claimed Austria was a victim of Nazi Germany rather than a collaborator. This theory, popular in the post-World War II era, was used to whitewash Austria's role in the Holocaust and avoid responsibility. 

The author points out that Austria was under Nazi rule from 1938 and participated in the Nazi regime's atrocities. Austrians made up a disproportionately large number of Nazi camp leadership, and approximately 65,000 Austrian Jews were murdered. The "first victim" theory was eventually discredited as Austria, in the 1990s, began to acknowledge its past and pay reparations to Holocaust survivors.

### [Bloodied but unbeaten: Trump gets a shot at immortality](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/donald-trump-usa-assassination-attempt-13792934.html)

A recent assassination attempt on Donald Trump during a campaign rally in Pennsylvania raises serious questions about security lapses.  Despite routine safeguarding of potential vantage points, the shooter was able to access a rooftop overlooking the podium. The incident, alongside historical examples of attempted assassinations targeting Republican presidents, highlights a concerning trend of political violence in the US.  

The article points to the heightened rhetoric surrounding Trump, with calls from some quarters to "stop him at all costs," potentially influencing the shooter's actions. Further investigation may shed light on the shooter's motivations and any security failings that allowed the attempt to occur.

### [First anniversary of Chandrayaan-3 mission: When India pioneered landing on lunar south pole](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/first-anniversary-of-chandrayaan-3-mission-when-india-pioneered-landing-on-lunar-south-pole-13792950.html)

India's Chandrayaan-3 mission successfully soft-landed a rover and lander on the lunar south pole on August 23, 2023, making India the fourth country to achieve robotic landings on the Moon and the first to land near the lunar south pole. 

The mission's success was a significant achievement for ISRO, following the failure of the Chandrayaan-2 mission's soft landing attempt in 2019. Chandrayaan-3's payloads collected data on the lunar surface, including confirmation of the presence of sulphur and other elements. While the mission was designed for a single lunar day of operation, future plans include ambitious missions like Chandrayaan-4, which aims to bring lunar samples back to Earth.

### [Harnessing innovation to meet India's net zero emissions goals by 2070](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/innovation-to-meet-indias-net-zero-emissions-goals-by-2070-13792906.html)

India faces a significant energy challenge, relying heavily on fossil fuels despite its ambition to reach net-zero emissions by 2070. 

Technology is crucial for achieving this goal, with advancements in waste-to-energy solutions, alternative fuels like green hydrogen, and improved battery chemistries offering promising pathways.

Necessity for efficient battery recycling is also highlighted, with innovations addressing the growing waste stream and promoting a circular economy for rare metals. 

Distributed renewable energy systems are key for expanding access and resilience, and a collaborative approach involving both public and private sectors will be essential to accelerate the implementation of these innovations.

### [Much more than a bear hug: Analysing India-Russia relations](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/on-india-russia-relations-13792883.html)

Prime Minister Modi's visit to Moscow for a summit with President Putin highlights India's commitment to dialogue and diplomacy while navigating the complexities of the Ukraine War.  India has consistently advocated for respecting territorial integrity and finding peaceful solutions.  Despite Western pressure, India has maintained its trade relations with Russia, including purchases of oil and weapons, presenting a model for other developing nations. The summit also resulted in agreements on bilateral trade expansion and the use of local currencies.  

Modi secured the release of Indian soldiers fighting for Russia in Ukraine, securing compensation and citizenship for them and their families. This diplomatic effort is significant, especially considering India's position as a developing nation seeking to maintain its strategic autonomy amidst global power dynamics.

### [Modi-Putin summit: America must understand that it cannot make India abandon Russia](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/modi-putin-summit-america-must-understand-that-it-cannot-make-india-abandon-russia-13792841.html)

India's recent visit by Prime Minister Modi to Moscow, amidst ongoing NATO tensions with Russia, has sparked debate about India's foreign policy balancing act.  While the US expressed pressure on India to sever ties with Russia, India maintained that its engagement with Russia is separate from its relationship with the West and stressed a need for peace talks to resolve the Ukraine conflict.

The article argues that India's relationship with Russia, while facing challenges, is multifaceted and strategically important. It cites the lack of significant progress on key issues expected from the visit, such as the trade deficit and the delivery of S-400 missile systems, as evidence of the decline in strategic convergence between the two countries. 

However, it highlights that India's recent actions, such as advocating for peace talks and condemning the attack on the children's hospital in Kyiv, demonstrate a nuanced approach that distinguishes it from nations like NATO.  The article concludes that India's engagement with Russia differs from China's increasing closeness with Russia and is driven by its unique geopolitical considerations, demanding a more understanding approach from the US-led West.

### [US envoy’s ‘undiplomatic’ rant on PM Modi’s Russia visit: It’s time America stopped taking India for granted](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/us-envoys-undiplomatic-rant-on-pm-modis-russia-visit-its-time-america-stopped-taking-india-for-granted-13792681.html)

The article analyzes Prime Minister Modi's recent Moscow visit during a significant NATO summit in Washington. It highlights the complex dynamics of the US-India relationship, arguing that the US has adopted a contradictory approach towards India, simultaneously promoting it as a close ally while engaging with forces seeking to undermine the current Indian government.  

The author criticizes the US for its double standards regarding  democracy and human rights, citing instances where the US has supported authoritarian regimes while criticizing India. He contends that the US needs to reassess its approach to India, emphasizing the need for genuine and consistent diplomatic engagement rather than a strategy that oscillates between support and subtle undermining.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Russia aimed to reinforce the bilateral relationship between India and  Russia, focusing on defense, energy, and trade. Discussions included potential acquisition of military equipment, joint production, and technological collaboration.  

Energy cooperation was a key point, with both nations exploring ways to strengthen their partnership amidst Western sanctions. Trade diversification beyond traditional sectors was also discussed, with a focus on pharmaceuticals, IT, agriculture, and infrastructure. 

Modi and Putin also addressed regional and global issues, including the conflict in Ukraine. While India maintained neutrality, it reiterated the importance of dialogue and diplomacy. The visit was seen as a strategic move for India, signaling its commitment to a multipolar world order and its pursuit of national interest.

### [How 'scarcity' of competent South Asian scholars mars perception of Indian democracy in West](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/how-scarcity-of-competent-south-asian-scholars-mars-perception-of-indian-democracy-in-west-13792606.html)

This article critiques the perspectives of Western scholars on Indian politics, particularly regarding the recent elections. The author argues that these scholars, often focused on left-leaning narratives, lack a genuine understanding of Indian complexities. 

The article specifically challenges the claim that the BJP's lack of Muslim support stems from their policies. It highlights the historical context of Muslim representation in Indian politics, pointing to a decline despite population growth, and attributes it to factors like Islamic supremacism and the legacy of the "Two Nation Theory." The author concludes by emphasizing the need for a more nuanced and native-centric understanding of India's social and political fabric.

### [Terror and talks can’t go together: Why India should not resume cricket diplomacy with Pakistan](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/terror-and-talks-cant-go-together-why-india-should-not-resume-cricket-diplomacy-with-pakistan-13792571.html)

The article discusses the upcoming ICC Champions Trophy, scheduled for Pakistan in 2025, and the potential for India to participate. It highlights the security concerns surrounding a potential visit of the Indian cricket team to Pakistan, citing a recent increase in terrorist incidents in Jammu and Kashmir as a cause for worry. The author emphasizes India’s stance that talks with Pakistan cannot coexist with terrorism,  referencing the recent attacks as a deliberate attempt to signal Pakistan's defiance. 

The article concludes by urging India to maintain its strong position against Pakistani terrorism and to engage diplomatically with the international community to pressure Pakistan to abandon its policy of using terrorism against India.

### [Iran at crossroads: How election of a new president can herald better Tehran-West ties](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/iran-at-crossroads-how-election-of-a-new-president-can-herald-better-tehran-west-ties-13792393.html)

The election of Masoud Pezeshkian as Iran's president has generated international interest and possibility for change. Pezeshkian's reformist stance, supported by a significant margin in the election, signifies a shift towards greater engagement with the West and a potential easing of tensions.  The election also demonstrates a positive change in Iran's image on the global stage, with increased support for liberal policies and a lessening of international isolation.  This new direction presents a window of opportunity for the West to engage with Iran, aiming to reduce its ties with China and Russia and facilitate a more stable regional environment.  The success of this engagement depends on several factors, including  actions within Iran,  the US's policy responses, and the progress of the Gaza war.

### [Pakistan Supreme Court verdict on reserved seats in national and provincial assemblies: A big boost to Imran Khan](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/pakistan-supreme-court-verdict-on-reserved-seats-in-national-and-provincial-assemblies-a-big-boost-to-imran-khan-13792331.html)

The Supreme Court of Pakistan ruled in a 8-5 split majority that 80 Independent members of the National Assembly who contested the February 2024 elections are entitled to be recognized as members of the Pakistan Tehreek-Insaaf (PTI).  The court deemed  relevant parts of previous high court and Election Commission orders as invalid and ruled that the PTI can submit lists for reserved seats within 15 days. The ruling is seen as a victory for the PTI but won't threaten the current ruling coalition's parliamentary majority.  While some minority and women MNAs may be affected, their votes in previous elections won't be reconsidered. Chief Justice Qazi Faiz Isa, while not part of the majority, expressed concerns about the ECP's interpretation of his earlier order.

### [Modi’s visit to Russia: An urge for strategic autonomy in a polarised world](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/modis-visit-to-russia-an-urge-for-strategic-autonomy-in-a-polarised-world-13792168.html)

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's visit to Russia was significant amidst global conflicts.  India reiterated its commitment to peace while receiving Russia's highest civilian honor.

Despite Western pressure, India has maintained a balanced approach in the Ukraine conflict,  opposing the war but abstaining from condemning Russia at the UN. This strategy reflects India's complex relationship triangle with Russia, China, and the US.

India seeks to balance its strategic interests, including a close partnership with the US against Chinese assertiveness, while maintaining close ties with Russia, a crucial arms supplier and a partner in promoting a multipolar world order. The visit signifies India's commitment to strategic autonomy and navigating the evolving global power dynamics.

### [Rumble in South China Sea: Bellicose China versus law-abiding others](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/rumble-in-south-china-sea-bellicose-china-versus-law-abiding-others-13791977.html)

The South China Sea (SCS) is witnessing a shift from dialogue to action as China’s growing assertiveness and violation of international norms trigger a regional response.  

China's recent aggressive actions, including harassment of fishing vessels and coast guard confrontations, have angered Southeast Asian nations, particularly the Philippines, despite Beijing’s calls for restored trust. 

The Philippines, emboldened by international support, notably from the US, Japan, and India, is bolstering its military capabilities and taking a tougher stance against China. This includes acquiring new military hardware, conducting joint exercises, and strengthening its alliances. 

The  situation in the SCS is further complicated by China's economic woes and its need to project strength to maintain domestic stability.  The global economy also risks disruption due to the SCS's strategic importance as a major trade route.    

The escalating tensions raise concerns about the possibility of conflict, potentially destabilizing the region and impacting global economic stability.

### [Don’t take them seriously! Anti-India bias runs deep in human rights groups in West](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/dont-take-them-seriously-anti-india-bias-runs-deep-in-human-rights-groups-in-west-13791940.html)

Human rights groups, including Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, are criticized for prioritizing political agendas over objective standards and methodological rigor.  The author cites instances of the groups supporting problematic regimes, engaging in biased reporting, and accepting funding that may compromise their impartiality.  

The focus on criticizing India, despite evidence of religious freedom and minority rights, is highlighted as a case in point. This, the author argues, stems from factors like dislike for Prime Minister Modi and the lucrative nature of securing funding by targeting India. The author concludes that until these organizations address their biases and conflicts of interest, their reports should be disregarded as politically motivated.

### [PM Modi’s Russia visit: Unpacking the layers of a complex relationship](https://www.firstpost.com/opinion/pm-modis-russia-visit-unpacking-the-layers-of-a-complex-relationship-13791759.html)

India's recent close ties with Russia aim to go beyond purely economic benefits like discounted oil and fertilizer. A key focus is on deepening defence cooperation, particularly technology transfer and maintenance support for crucial platforms like Sukhoi fighter jets.  While Russia continues to be a dominant supplier of India's military equipment, India also seeks to diversify its procurements. 

Despite the strong defence partnership, a significant trade deficit persists, highlighting the need for increased Russian investment in the Indian market. The geopolitical complexities posed by the Ukraine war and the India-China border dispute cast a shadow on the relationship,  limiting the scope of the partnership.

The article discusses the legal framework surrounding astronaut health and rescue in space, highlighting the need for improved international norms.  Existing international space law, including the Outer Space Treaty of 1967 and the Rescue Agreement of 1968, emphasize the responsibility of states to ensure astronaut safety and provide assistance in distress.
